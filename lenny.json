Each week I tackle reader questions about product, growth, career, and anything else that’s stressing you out about your work.SubscribeQ: How do strategy, vision, mission, goals, and roadmap all work together? Where should I start?First, some definitions:Mission: What are we trying to achieve?Vision: What does the world look like when we’ve achieved it?Strategy: What’s our plan for achieving it, i.e. what’s our plan to win? Goals: How will we measure progress?Roadmap: What do we need to build in order to get there?Task: What’s one unit of work we can tackle next?Where should you start? Normally you start with your mission—why does your team (or company) even exist? What are you trying to achieve? What is your purpose?Some examples of great missions:Tesla: “Accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.”TED: “Spread ideas.”Stripe: “Increase the GDP of the internet.”IKEA: “Create a better everyday life for the many people.”Patagonia: “Use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis.”Slack: “Make work life simpler, more pleasant, and more productive.”Google: “Organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”World Wildlife Fund: “Conserve nature and reduce the most pressing threats to the diversity of life on Earth.”Nike: “Do everything possible to expand human potential.” Square: “Make commerce easy.”VisionNext comes your vision: What does the world (or your product) look like when you’ve achieved your mission?Some examples of great vision statements:Microsoft: “A computer on every desk and in every home.”Alzheimer’s Association: “A world without Alzheimer’s disease.”Teach for America: “One day, all children in this nation will have the opportunity to attain an excellent education.”Tesla: “Create the most compelling car company of the 21st century.”Lyft: “A world where cities feel small again. Where transportation and tech bring people together, instead of apart.”Netflix: “Become the best global entertainment distribution service.”If you start with your vision before your mission, that’s totally OK. Elon Musk likely started with a vision of the world he wanted to see and then developed his mission around that. No problem. Don’t overthink it.StrategyOnce you have your mission and vision, this is where strategy comes in. Your strategy is simply your plan to achieve your vision—your plan to win.I’ve written about getting better at strategy, and, to boil it down, a strategy is essentially a short description of your plan, with 3 to 5 concrete investments that, if you get right, will bring you closer to winning (i.e. achieving your vision). Here are some templates to help you frame your thinking.Here are some high-level examples of strategies:Tesla: Build a high-priced sports car → Use that revenue to build an affordable car → Use that revenue to build an even more affordable car → While doing so, also provide zero-emission electric powerUber: Launch Uber Black → Bring prices down by launching UberX → Bring prices down by launching Uber Pool → Bring prices down by launching scooters, bikes, etc.Substack: Build powerful publishing tools for writers → Help writers become better writers through value-add services → Grow their audience through network effectsAdditional examples of great real-life strategies:GitLab: Notice the clear mission, vision, and three-part strategy.Salesforce: Simple, but tells you exactly what needs to be done.Yahoo’s “peanut butter” memo: Notice how clearly this identifies the problem, and includes a three-part strategy. (Also, it’s obviously memorable since it’s now known as the “Peanut Butter Manifesto.”)Tesla: Notice the narrative style, the detailed identification of the problems, and the very simple, ambitious yet clear four-step strategy at the end.Teresa Torres’s opportunity solution tree framework is a great way to think through, and communicate, your strategy:GoalsNext, you can begin to define your goal. Goals are simply a way to measure the progress of your strategy toward achieving your ultimate vision.Some examples of visions and their associated goals:Microsoft: A computer on every desk and in every home → X% of homes with a computerTeach for America: One day, all children in this nation will have the opportunity to attain an excellent education → X% of children with educationAlzheimer’s Association: A world without Alzheimer’s disease → X% decrease in Alzheimer’s casesHere’s my advice on setting goals and on choosing your North Star metric.RoadmapAnd finally, once you have your goals, you can align around and prioritize a roadmap. Here’s a template you can use.Within the roadmap, you break out individual tasks, the atomic unit of work for your teammates.Why do you need goals before you align around a roadmap and prioritize tasks? Because when prioritizing the many ideas your team has, you look at the ROI—the effort vs. the impact. The impact you’re prioritizing against is based on how much you expect the project will impact your goals.That’s basically your plan as a product team, from the 10,000-foot mission to the day-to-day work of your team.As an example, here’s how it all fits together in the case of Tesla:And finally, let’s look at another “real-life” example:Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap → Task, as taught to us by Oceans ElevenMission: Rob the Bellagio, Mirage, and MGM Grand casinos, and get back at rival Terry Benedict"},{"title":"My favorite product management templates","article":"Hello and welcome to the free monthly edition of my weekly newsletter.

Each week I humbly tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out at the office.If you’re not a paid subscriber, here’s what you missed this month:How to increase your product’s viralityBecoming a senior product managerExamples of great job descriptionsSubscribeQ: Which startups are best at content-driven growth, and what can I learn from them?This question got me thinking—what are all the ways that content can drive growth? There’s obviously SEO. There are also viral blog posts, user-generated content (UGC), editorially produced blog posts, data-generated pages, and so on. What other strategies are there, and how do they all fit together?Here’s my best attempt at mapping out the landscape of content-driven growth:Where you sit on this 2x2 is based on what you’re optimizing for (SEO vs. virality) and who’s generating the content (users vs. employees).I posit that there are five unique content-driven growth strategies:Let’s break this down:User-Generated SEO-Optimized (UGSO): Your users generate public content that Google finds and surfaces in organic search. This primarily drives the growth of companies like Quora, Glassdoor, and Reddit.Editorially generated SEO-optimized (EGSO): Employees (or contractors) of the company create content with the goal of ranking higher for certain keywords. This primarily drives the growth of companies like Ahrefs, Slidebean, and HubSpot.Data-generated SEO-optimized (DGSO): This strategy is the combination of UGC and Editorial—your company auto-magically generates thousands of individual pages off your UGC and proprietary data. This primarily drives the growth of companies like Thumbtack, Zapier, Tripadvisor, Yelp, and Grubhub.User-generated virality-optimized (UGVO): UGC leads to users sharing that content with their friends, which then pulls those friends into the product. TikTok is the ultimate example of this (users sharing watermarked videos with each other), as is the Reface app. The edges of this zone include Airbnb listings (that users share with each other) and Zillow’s Zestimate (which homeowners pass around).Editorially generated virality-optimized (EGVO): Employees/founders make one-off viral content—also known as thought leadership or brand building: content that the founder/company creates with the goal of having that content spread through word of mouth. This includes Spotify Unwrapped, along with virality-oriented creators like Mr. Beast, Stir’s one-off drops, and Superhuman’s early blog posts.In previous posts, we’ve explored the top-left quadrant (data and user-generated SEO), and the bottom half (viral growth strategies), so in this post I’d like to zero in on the less explored top-right quadrant, editorially generated SEO-optimized (EGSO):I asked Twitter which companies do this type of content-driven growth best, and four companies came up over and over: Slidebean, Ahrefs, Intercom, and HubSpot.(Also Webflow, but we’ll get to that later.)I reached out to the founders and/or heads of content at each of these companies and asked them if they’d be willing to share their lessons. They all very generously agreed 🙌Below you’ll find their answers to the following questions:What convinced them to put resources behind creating content?What kind of resources did they put into content initially?What do the content team and resources look like now?How do they operationalize the content creation?What advice would they give companies pursuing content-driven growth now?A huge thank-you to Caya (Slidebean), Tim Soulo (Ahrefs), Kieran Flanagan (HubSpot), John Collins (Intercom), and Mischa Vaughn for sharing these insights with the world.Note: Intercom and Webflow don’t fit squarely into this EGSO category (they aren’t primarily SEO-driven), but I decided to include them in this post anyway because their perspectives are instructive.High-level takeaways:Start small: Start scrappy and play around with platform, topic, and style until you find something that works.Align on a clear goal: Is your goal to bring SEO traffic, to drive virality, to build your brand, or to enable sales? Make sure you’re clear on this.Hunt for opportunity: Research topics where searchers are underserved, and create content that delivers compelling, valuable, and differentiated value to those searchers.Give the reins to someone who cares: The best content will be produced by people who truly care about the product/business/topic—normally, the founders or a passionate full-time employee.Think long-term: Make sure there’s a clear path to this investment making a significant dent in your growth. Is the upside even worth it?Build a dedicated team: Eventually you’ll need at least five people dedicated to this effort, even more if you’re doing video.Be patient: It took years for each company chronicled below to see significant payoff.Any other takeaways as you read this post?

Most popular content:RICE: Simple prioritization for product managersDesign workshops that work: how to get better at brainstormingWhat is a product manager and what do they do?HubSpot: In HubSpot’s early days, 30% or more of their customers came from demand generated by their blog posts. Also, if you look at their web traffic (organic, direct, referral), it’s bigger than a lot of other online business publications, like TechCrunch, etc. It’s why they always think of their competition for online attention as other media outlets vs. other SaaS brands.Let’s dive in.1. What convinced you to put resources behind creating content?Slidebean:“We noticed that the traffic coming from the ‘pitch deck’ keyword on SEM was clearly our best type of lead. We doubled down, and very quickly we maxed out the SEM keyword and were already the first result across our target geos. The problem was, of course, SEM traffic is expensive, and not enough (only about 5% of searches). So we started focusing on SEO, around startup-related keywords. This was the first major marketing breakthrough for the company.That year, we produced a lot of content (~150 articles) and, after a few months, managed to get to 3-5 SERP rankings for most of the keywords we had focused on. For the next two years, that traffic drove our growth. Eventually, though, we realized that getting to 1-2 rank was probably not going to happen regardless of how many articles we published, so we figured we had to find ‘the next’ search engine: YouTube.Our first strategy on YouTube was SEO: creating videos that answer questions people are looking for (i.e. ‘pitch deck’).Once we built an audience, we produce content focused on the YouTube algorithm: focused on high CTRs, high watch time, topics that appeal to broad audiences and sharing. The thing with sharing is that we have little control on that decision. I spoke about that here:HubSpot:“HubSpot started publishing before they even had a product to sell.At that time, [co-founder] Dharmesh [Shah] had been creating content and building a community through OnStartups. Through that site’s success, both Dharmesh and [co-founder] Brian [Halligan] saw how much of an audience you could grow to your content if it provided value. It’s how inbound marketing came to be—create assets of value for your audience vs. pay money to interrupt them via traditional advertising.HubSpot grew through inbound marketing, creating things of value for our audience. There are two parts to our media strategy:Content to educate. People find this content through search, typically a blog post. Some of those people sign up to get a more comprehensive piece of content—e-book, template, course.Content to influence. We create original stories for our audience around business trends, stories, and case studies featuring successful companies. These are across channels like video and podcasts. Our goal is to get a large audience for these stories.”Ahrefs:“I’m not sure that this was a single well-thought-out decision to start producing content and allocate a certain amount of resources there. If I remember correctly, the process of ramping up our content operations was very gradual.When I joined Ahrefs back in 2015, I inherited their already existing blog, which wasn’t too popular back in the day, even though they had a team of outsourced writers and published content a few times per week.And because I always thought of myself as a ‘blogger’ and ‘content marketer,’ I naturally started looking into ways we could make our blog better. And then it just kept escalating :)”Intercom:“For the four co-founders, Intercom was not their first startup. They had come up through the Web 2.0 era, so blogging and sharing lessons learned was just part of their DNA, particularly for Eoghan [McCabe] and Des [Traynor]. They were regularly sharing opinionated takes on what they had learned building software products and growing Intercom and other businesses. When I joined to establish a formal content team, about 2.5 years after Intercom was founded, they had built up a sizable reputation and audience with that strategy. Des wrote the first ~100 posts.We initially focused on high-quality editorial content as a way to stand out from the SEO-driven approach which was the norm at the time. People were happy to promote and share that kind of content, and on the flip side the customers who came to us through the blog and podcast spent more and hung around for longer, as they bought into the product and business philosophy we shared through our content. We gate some content as a way to generate leads, but we always make sure it’s a fair value exchange, i.e. for sharing your email you’re going to get a book that teaches you something meaningful about customer support and is well-written and -designed.More recently we’ve been focused on enablement—making sure that the kind of content you see on the blog or hear on the podcast is available in the formats that are needed by our sales team and other marketing functions like account-based marketing and paid acquisition.”2. What kind of resources did you put into content initially?Intercom:“For the first year, I was the entire team (some of the engineers used to jokingly call me ‘team blog’), but I had a lot of support from our brand design team, and everyone at the company was incentivized to create content—whether that was writing blog posts, speaking at events, hosting podcasts, etc. We didn’t pay people or anything, but by, e.g., adding content creation to personal and team goals, it was clear it was part of your job as a product manager/designer/engineer and benefited you in terms of career growth. So while I was the only person with ‘content’ in my job title, we invested significant time and resources into it.”Slidebean:“The first YouTube videos were edited by me, so they only cost a bit of time. We were lucky to have a couple of people on the team who had a background in video production, so we all carved out some time to experiment. This made video experiments very cheap. For the first year or so, our videos sucked, and they didn’t get any traffic at all, but we didn’t suffer because we had spent very little money to produce them. This allowed us to do a trial-error game with YouTube for over 18 months until we finally found the format that worked.”3. What do the content team and resources look like now?Ahrefs:“Initially I had some budget to find proper talent to create content for our blog, plus I could ‘distract’ our designers to make the pages of our blog look better.I can’t recall any tipping points when we decided to double down on our content marketing. We were moving in small steps and gradually improved things here and there.”HubSpot:“HubSpot’s marketing strategy was ‘inbound marketing,’ so all early hires focused on creating some form of content—blogs, social posts, webinars, etc.”4. What do the content team and resources look like now?Slidebean:“Our YouTube team goes like this:Content/Strategy Manager: me1 Lead Digital Animator, 2 Jr. Animators—all full-time2x screenwriters, who mostly take care of the research pieces (Company Forensics)Community Manager in charge of engaging with the YouTube audience and publishing the videosWe are publishing a video this week on how much we spent on video production—it came to ~$125K for 2020.”HubSpot:“We’re very ambitious about having a real media company within HubSpot. Inbound/media has always been how we’ve differentiated ourselves from most other SaaS brands. We’re so serious about this, we bought a media company.We break our media out across teams who educate and teams who build influence. We have teams for:HubSpot’s Blogs (a mix of education and influence)HubSpot Content Offers (e-books, templates, courses)HubSpot Stories (original stories featuring business trends, case studies, and in-depth breakdowns of successful companies)HubSpot YouTube (a mix of education and influence)HubSpot Audio (podcasts, Clubhouse)Daily Newsletter (run by The Hustle)Trends (premium content subscription run by The Hustle)Distribution (to ensure we have the right promotion plan for the above assets).”Intercom:“We’re a team of 10 based in Dublin, Ireland (with three additional positions opening this quarter). There’s three pillars, or sub-teams, within the team:The Audiences pillar think about who we’re actually selling our products to, which is mostly customer support and customer success leaders these days. Their job is to create great top-of-funnel content that will attract that audience but also to really understand where they get their information from, what conferences they attend, who are they influenced by, etc.The Enablement pillar are focused on taking that content and reworking it for the needs of sales and other marketing teams, e.g. taking a research report we’ve commissioned and turning it into slides that account execs can use in pitch decks. Enablement also looks after all our customer evidence—from the full-blown customer stories we publish on the website to securing permission for logo usage in our other marketing materials.The Channels pillar are the specialist functions that work across both audiences and enablements—right now that’s SEO and our podcast.”Ahrefs:“We have Josh, who is in charge of our blog content, and two in-house marketers who are creating content together with Josh: SQ and Michal.Patrick is responsible for slightly more technical content on our blog, but he does it part-time, since he also belongs to our product team and his feedback is needed there too.We also have Sam, who is in charge of our video content.He has three people helping him with video production.And we have one graphic designer, who takes care of all the needs of our marketing team.”5. How do you operationalize the content creation?HubSpot:“We’ve created a pretty great model around how SEO-orientated content works.We have full-time analysts that help us build quarterly editorial calendars across all blogs. Those editorial calendars include a mix of search-first posts and posts focused on garnering influence.We know how much net new search traffic is available for new editorial calendars, so we know roughly how much net new traffic we can expect to acquire. Think of this as a quarterly TAM, so we know if/when we’re running out of net new traffic we can acquire on certain content topics.We also have a team that gets notified about posts that are falling in traffic and then optimizes them to improve their traffic and conversions.”Slidebean:“These days, we use this tool to decide what videos to make. I partially summarized how we got started and how we operate today in these two YouTube videos:”6. What advice would you give companies pursuing content-driven growth?Ahrefs:“I would advise them to contemplate the difference between ‘viral content’ and ‘SEO content’ and decide which type would work better for them.In my opinion, SEO content is a lot easier than viral content. And the primary reason for that is finding topics to write about. With SEO content, you find your topics via keyword research, where the popularity of Google searches helps you decide what to write about, while with viral content, you don’t have such a straightforward source of content ideas, and your success largely depends on your creativity and ability to come up with unique ideas that would resonate with your industry.”HubSpot:“A company early in their growth, looking at our media group above, might feel a little defeated: ‘How can I ever compete with that?’HubSpot started with a blog, and that was our core focus for a long time—years. We invested in new channels as we mastered existing ones.There is always room to be better or different. You need to decide on the media channel that best maps to your audience and then work on your ‘better or different.’The thing brands need to realize is they’re not only competing with direct competitors. They’re competing with every tweet, post, podcast that is vying for some of their audience’s precious time. You need to publish media that is great. Good no longer gets you results.I would also be intentional about the goals you want your media efforts to serve. Most companies I speak with initially care about how media can drive demand for their products or services. But they’re unsure of how to quantify what impact it could have.For example, if you want to generate demand through blogging, most of it will come via search. You can do a rough model to see how much search traffic is available for topics you’ll cover and, using rough conversion rates, what’s the TAM of demand for those topics.Being intentional about the goals ensures everyone is aligned on the purpose of the different media you’ll create. Maybe you want a podcast with a large following to help influence your audience. Maybe you want a successful blog because you think it can equate to 20% of the demand you need to generate for your product or service. And so on.Once you’ve decided on those goals, invest in being great at one thing, mastering it, being better or different, and then continuing to build upon that success with new channels.”Intercom:“Content marketing initiatives don’t generate returns as quickly as other forms of marketing, so be sure to hold your nerve. But once you start to see an audience engage with a particular format or channel, double down on it quickly. And don’t be afraid to focus on that particular medium rather than trying to do everything at once, i.e. if you’ve started to have some success with a podcast, don’t suddenly start to try spinning up a YouTube channel. As I like to say, content is a supertanker, not a speedboat.”Slidebean:“Video content is expensive and a long-term bet! It will take months to create an audience, and that means dozens of videos. If you have to hire someone for the production, it will be an expensive bet and one that few companies will be able to afford. Even if you’re doing it internally/yourself, it’s going to take away a big chunk of your time. Most startups need customers faster, in a way they can more directly control for scale, and YouTube is not ideal for that. When it’s working, it’s a real beauty. We’ve seen people engage and recall our brand better than ever (look at what happened with your tweet, which drove ~5K visits to our website—thanks!). That power of a brand is something that we hadn’t really seen with our own eyes until now, and we probably should have focused on it a lot sooner.”Thanks, Caya (Slidebean), Tim Soulo (Ahrefs), Kieran Flanagan (HubSpot), and John Collins (Intercom) 🙏🎁 Bonus: How Webflow uses video content to increase new-user activationThe four companies we looked at above use content with primarily one goal: to drive top-of-funnel traffic. Webflow does this too; however, even more interestingly, they use content in a very different way: to increase new-user success. They create compelling videos to help users be successful with Webflow. For example:What’s interesting about this strategy is that, unlike SEO-based growth, any (B2B) company can leverage video to increase activation or conversion. There’s a lot to learn from Webflow’s success with video content.To learn about Webflow’s approach, I got in touch with Mischa Vaughn, the director of content and communications at Webflow, who very generously agreed to share lessons on behalf of the education team at Webflow. Thanks, Mischa and the education team!Q: Why did Webflow invest in content so early?“Webflow’s visual interface gives designers the same control over the same exact CSS properties used by Apple, Google, Stripe, etc. It’s no watered-down interface. We know that. Thus we made a big investment into our content when we created Webflow University, to help designers of all skill levels learn to use our powerful platform for free.”Q: What inspired you to invest in video specifically?“Video was always a high priority for Webflow. Even on the day we launched, one of the founders created a full-site build walkthrough that was crucial in onboarding customers. But one day in 2016, a passionate member of our community posted his own tutorial video that was at a much higher production caliber, and we immediately knew from the community’s positive reaction that this was a direction we needed to adopt. Eventually we hired this person to lead our education team.Webflow University’s course structure creates a natural progression to becoming more and more of an expert in using Webflow.”Q: What was the video content team like initially?“One person (a power user) was hired to run education, and video was always part of it. It was one person full-time, but he also worked closely with a few other folks in support to write documentation and guides.”Q: What impact have these courses had on growth?“The people who enroll in our courses are much more likely to become subscribers to the service. New courses help us find new people and help them take on specific use cases or introduce them to new features.”We’ve also made sure our non-tutorial content features inspirational examples of the product and helpful advice and resources for designers (our target audience). We keep our social channels fun and engaging, with the idea of presenting the brand as a friend you want to hang around. This mix of value and an engaging tone has helped make a compelling case for the millions of people who use Webflow.”Q: What does the content team look like now?“Since 2016, we devoted a substantial budget and headcount to our education efforts. This includes building out a devoted team, modern camera and recording equipment, a soundproof studio, and custom music and animation. Our education team features a mix of producers, editors, and designers. Our content marketing team works with a mix of freelancers and agencies, and we have plans to double this team’s headcount in the coming year.”Q: Any advice for companies thinking about pursuing this?“If you’re going to invest in content, especially video, you need a devoted team with a clear charter. Find someone to lead this team, build a distinct vision and voice, and give them plenty of support.”Thank you, Mischa!And thank you to everyone else who contributed to this post: Caya (Slidebean), Tim Soulo (Ahrefs), Kieran Flanagan (HubSpot), John Collins (Intercom), Peter Kazanjy, Jiaona Zhang (JZ), and Brian Ta.That’s it for this week!

Now, on to this week’s post…Q: I’m building an app targeted at consumers, and plan to charge a monthly fee. I’d love your advice around what it takes to build a durable business as a B2C subscription app.Think about it: When was the last time you (1) installed, (2) paid for, and (3) continued to pay for, a new app? I bet you it’s been a while. For me, it was upgrading to Twitter Blue, and I’m probably going to cancel it. I certainly pay for apps (e.g. AllTrails, Centered, Copilot, Future, and a few streaming services), but I’ve tried and discarded 10x more over the years. Consumers (e.g. you and me) are busy, distractible, always looking for something new. A couple of years ago, GP Bullhound created this map of B2C subscription apps. How many are still thriving? A very small percentage. Source: GP BullhoundIt’s brutal out there. But it’s not hopeless. There are a number of consumer apps that have stood the test of time, including some of my favorites: Grammarly, Duolingo, Noom, Calm, Flo, Future, and Spotify. To answer your question, I went deep into these seven companies (along with a few up-and-comers like Copilot, Centered, Mighty Health, and Greg) to understand what it takes to win in the B2C subscription space. Here’s what stood out:An obsession with efficiencyAlignment between product strategy and acquisition strategyA singular focus to build a magical, sticky product through rapid iteration and endless optimizationBelow I’ll share stories and insights from each of these companies, but remember, a lot goes into building a successful company. Following all of this advice won’t guarantee you make it. In the end you still need to build something people want, continue to want, and make money doing it. But these tips will certainly help your odds.Thank you, Alex Ross (Greg), Andres Ugarte (Copilot), Artem Petakov (Noom), Cem Kansu (Duolingo), James Li (Mighty Health), Nick Lisher (Flo), Nikhil Jhunjhnuwala (Noom), Rasmus Andersson (Spotify), Rishi Mandal (Future), Ulf Schwekendiek (Centered), and Yuriy Timen (Grammarly), for sharing their insights and advice with me for this post 🙏Pattern #1: Obsession with efficiencyThe most common thread across every company was an obsession with efficiency—staying small, keeping costs down, and getting profitable. They all stayed lean until they found strong product-market fit and, in many cases, far beyond that.In the case of Calm, an early employee shared that “for years, they had a hard time getting funding, so they were left with no alternative but to make the business profitable. They were obsessed with profitability, margins, and LTV/CAC. They kept the team size under 10, worked long hours in a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco, and sharply questioned every outgoing dollar.”At Grammarly, Yuriy Timen (ex-Head of Growth) shared a similar story:“Grammarly was bootstrapped, so it could go really deep on R&D without the external pressure to launch too quickly. We remained self-funded for a while, which just built a culture and operating identity of being lean, efficient, and focusing on sustainable growth. If I had to guess, Grammarly was probably 2-4x leaner than other companies of comparable scale, which also allowed us to maintain profitability. This applied to hiring as well—Grammarly always paced its hiring goals based on its ability to maintain cultural cohesion and operational excellence.”Same with Noom, as Artem Petakov (co-founder) shared:“We were all living and working in one apartment for two years.”Nikhil Jhunjhnuwala (VP of Growth at Noom) went deeper:“We were very lean in the first few years. From 2016 to 2018, I don’t think the growth team had more than 10 people (across all of creative, marketing, growth product, etc.). For context, in late 2016 we started gaining traction, ending the year at $3-4M in revenue.Staying small forced us to develop hacking skills. I [a PM] was a top contributor to the growth repo. One growth marketer was responsible for all our spend, and always ruthlessly prioritizing. The experience helped define growth culture at Noom.I also think it helped that we targeted one-month payback, which allowed us to immediately reinvest money into our performance marketing engine, making us less reliant on raising money to grow. We started hiring significantly in 2019 after raising a round with Sequoia, once we were well past $60M in revenue/year.”And at Future, as Rishi Mandal (CEO) shared: “Efficiency, and the discipline to keep our team and footprint small, has allowed us to do something that I think category-creating consumer businesses have to be able to do, which is to be misunderstood for a number of years. When we started Future, we felt that the broader world (consumers, investors, our friends, the press) may not fully grasp why connected coaching is a game changer until we showed it to them at scale. With this in mind, we aimed to keep our team size and cost structure small so that we could fund years of patient development and growth. To compensate for this smaller size, we’ve hired a team of talented and experienced people, where each team member is trusted with a lot of scope and decision-making power.”It’s probably not a coincidence that the founders of all five of the biggest B2C subscription companies are immigrants: Noom and Grammarly’s founders were from Ukraine, Duolingo’s founder is from Guatemala, Calm’s from the U.K., and Spotify’s from Sweden.Takeaway: Stay as lean as possible, and focus on revenue over growth—at least until you’ve found PMF.Pattern #2: Alignment between product strategy and acquisition strategyThe second most consistent pattern across these companies was an inseparable alignment between the product roadmap and the growth engine. Surviving in B2C is all about finding an efficient (aka cheap) growth channel. All of these five teams found a way to grow very efficiently—either through word of mouth or highly optimized paid ads."},{"title":"How to develop product sense","article":"👋 Hey, Lenny here! Welcome to a ✨ monthly free edition ✨ of my weekly newsletter. Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out about work. If you’re not a subscriber, here’s what you missed this month:Freemium vs. trialWhat is good waitlist conversionWhat is good monthly churnSubscribeQ: How do I develop product sense?Your question implies that it can be developed, and to that point, I 1,000% agree. Contrary to what a lot of PMs believe, product sense is not something you need to be born with. It’s a learned skill, just like any other PM skill. Sure, some people are naturally better at it, but that’s OK. You don’t need to be in the 99th percentile of this skill to be an incredibly successful PM. That being said, you are building a product as your job, and are often the final word on product decisions, so you absolutely do need to develop your product sense muscle, especially as you move up in seniority.To help you build your product sense, I’ve asked Jules Walter, a longtime PM at Slack and YouTube who’s also a prominent leader in the broader PM community, to share his hard-earned wisdom with us. Below, Jules unravels the mystery that is product sense. He shares a ton of actionable and practical advice to develop your product sense, explains what product sense is, how to know if you’re getting better, and dives deep into four concrete ways to build this skill with a bunch of examples from his own experience. Enjoy!You can follow Jules on Twitter and LinkedIn.P.S. You can now hear this post in audio form 👇Product sense is not only one of the most important PM skills (see chart below from Lenny’s survey of ~1,000 PMs)—it’s also the most vague. And it’s often the hardest to learn.SourceThere isn’t much written on the subject, and as a PM trying to improve your product sense, you may not know if you’re any good at it, or how to get better. I want to help.What exactly is product sense? 🤔Product sense is the skill of consistently being able to craft products (or make changes to existing products) that have the intended impact on their users. Product sense relies on (1) empathy to discover meaningful user needs and (2) creativity to come up with solutions that effectively address those needs.You likely have good product sense if you’ve championed successful features or products that were not obvious to others. Here are some examples of products born out of strong product sense:The original iPhone was built on the insight that people value aesthetics, and not just functionality, in their products. It was designed around the idea that consumers needed a smartphone that felt personal.The original Gmail responded to unmet user needs at the time. It addressed common user problems, including low storage quotas, poor search experience, and related messages separated from each other (instead of being combined in a thread).Superhuman saw a need for a modern email client to allow busy professionals to get through emails quickly. It used thoughtful design to support fast email workflows and limit distractions.Each of these products originated with strong product sense and offered creative solutions to previously unmet user needs.Building product senseI was the first PM on Slack’s growth team, where I spent more than four years building product experiences used by millions of people. I’m now a product leader at YouTube, where I’m building a yet-to-be-released zero-to-one product.In my roles, I’ve relied on product sense to bring unique insights to the table and drive user value and business impact. In this article, I will be discussing four practices for building product sense. Building empathy:Observe people interacting with productsDeconstruct everyday productsImproving creativity:Learn from great product thinkersBe curious about changes in technology and your domainLet’s get to it.1. Observe people interacting with products 🕵🏾One approach to developing empathy—and thus, product sense—is to repeatedly observe people using products, whether yours or other companies’. This practice will help you get better at identifying subtle user needs that others miss (e.g. social, emotional, or functional needs).You can start small. Initially, I recommend doing this two to four times a month for your product. Don’t just read reports from researchers on your team; instead attend user research sessions to get firsthand exposure to user experiences and reactions. What’s important is to pay attention to micro details and ask yourself why people react to your product the way they do. Observe their facial expressions as they try various aspects of your product, and try to spot moments when they’re hesitant, confused, excited, etc. In those moments, ask open-ended questions to better understand not just how they feel but, more importantly, why.Here are some sample questions you can ask:What do you think the purpose of this product is? Who do you think it’s for? This will give you a sense of how effective your product’s landing page is. It also gives you ideas for words to describe your product that resonate with people.Now that you’re in the product, what actions do you want to take? This will help you understand which features are easy to discover and how clear your product’s navigation and calls to action are.What are you thinking right now? How does that make you feel? I tend to ask this at every new step the user lands on, because people tend not to notice their self-talk and feelings otherwise.When I joined Slack in 2016, our data indicated high churn rates for new users on mobile. We wanted to understand why, so we set up user research sessions and asked questions such as the ones above. Through those questions and through observing users, we learned that:Many people didn’t really understand what Slack did, even after visiting our homepage, which was too abstract at the time.People would land in the Slack app and not know what to do because of competing calls to action.People didn’t want to give permission to their mobile address book, because it had their friends’ contact info and not their colleagues’.These new insights led us to come up with experiment ideas that enabled us to improve Slack’s product experience for new users and significantly increase the product’s retention rate. Below is one such experiment, which removed friction in the invite step and addressed users’ concerns around giving permission to their address books.After observing hundreds of people use products I’ve worked on (whether in research sessions or coffee shops etc.) and asking them questions about their usage, I’ve developed better instincts about how people will react to various product experiences. Here are five quick lessons about product usage that have stuck with me:People are time-crunched and distracted when they use your product. They might not read labels or text and might not be willing to spend even a few seconds to figure out what to do next. Pick the right defaults and use visual design and cues to make primary actions obvious (e.g. prominence, lack of distractions).People will drop out of a product flow as soon as they feel confused or nervous that they might be doing something wrong. Make sure labels are unambiguous and contrast options appropriately.Don’t give people too much information at once, because once they feel overwhelmed, they tend to leave. For example, we ran pricing page experiments at Slack and saw increases in purchases when we moved some of the information on the various purchase options behind a dropdown list.Context impacts decisions. Use tools like comparisons, contrasting, and social proof to make it easier for users to make a decision.Make sure the goal of your product and possible actions are clear to users. At Slack, we often heard from users that they didn’t know what Slack was really about and what they could do with the app. We experimented with various onboarding experiences to address that issue, and one early experiment on mobile increased user retention just by telling new users what Slack is and linking to a video showing people how a work team might use it on desktop and mobile.The more frequently and closely you watch people using products, the more observant you’ll become and the more empathy you’ll develop.2. Deconstruct everyday products 👨🏾‍🔧️Another approach to developing empathy is to observe yourself using everyday products. I spend one or two hours a month trying out new products and deconstructing them. The goal is to strengthen my intuition about why some products work well and others don’t—this also helps me identify common UX best practices and paradigms. While deconstructing products, I recommend asking the types of questions Julie Zhuo shares in the article How to Do a Product Critique, such as: What’s the experience of getting started or signing up?How does this app explain itself in the first minute?How easy to use was the app?How did you feel while exploring the app?Did the app deliver on your expectations?If you want to go deeper in your understanding of a product, I recommend also looking at other products in the same category and comparing and contrasting them. For example, to better understand a product like Cash App, compare it with Venmo. You’ll see that these two seemingly similar money apps are fundamentally different. Below are a few dimensions you can look at to compare two products and better understand how they approach product decisions.By comparing a product with others in the space, some of the product design choices become more salient and it’s easier to get hints of the product’s strategy. For example, in the Cash App vs. Venmo comparison, it seems Venmo’s strategy is to lean into its social graph (use Venmo because your friends are already on it and you can easily make sure you’re sending the money to the right person), whereas Cash App is focused on ease of use and breadth of capabilities for people who want to go beyond just peer-to-peer transfers (run your personal finances or small business from your phone).When I use new products, I also observe my own self-talk and feelings, including moments of frustration, such as:I’m trying to log in to my medical app to set up an appointment, but I’m unable to because I can’t remember my password. The password reset flow never sent me an email, even after multiple attempts, and I just stopped using the service.I’m trying to rent a car, but as soon as I input the start time, the interface shows an error message telling me that the end time can’t be before the start time. I was going to update the end time anyway, and now I feel stupid and frustrated while using this product, which is not a feeling you want your users to have.I also note moments when I experience delight, such as:Carta’s stock-vesting email could have been just text letting me know that I’ve vested into more shares, but it also includes an animation with confetti that takes my feeling of celebration to another level.Google Photos collages combine multiple photos of the people who matter to me the most in delightful ways.One bonus practice I recommend for improving your empathy and observation skills is meditation. I’ve been meditating for years, and it’s helped me become more perceptive—not just of other people’s feelings but also of my own. If you are new to meditation, I recommend starting with an app or joining a meditation community to help you form a daily habit.​​The more frequently and closely you observe people (and yourself), the more insight you will gain into their motivations and needs, and the more your empathy will grow.3. Learn from great product thinkers 📓One of the biggest levers for developing creativity (and again, product sense) is to spend time with people who already have it.My creativity improved significantly after I joined Slack, partly because I observed how people like CEO Stewart Butterfield approached building products. If you’ve never worked at a company with strong product thinkers, I recommend joining such a company at some point in your career to strengthen your product fundamentals—the earlier, the better. If you’re not sure which companies to consider, start by thinking of companies whose products you use and love.Once you’re at a company with great product thinkers, I recommend attending as many product reviews as you can. Take copious notes during the reviews, and look for patterns in the questions and feedback you hear—i.e. what type of comments keep coming up. Over time, you’ll understand the mental checklists your product leaders use to ensure that new product ideas will be successful, and you’ll identify the principles they use to make product decisions and trade-offs.One of the things I learned from my exposure to Stewart Butterfield is that every detail about the user experience matters. “The details are not the details,” he would say, quoting designer Charles Eames. “They make the design.” Stewart’s obsession with the details is one of the main reasons why Slack exists and is used by millions of people.For example, if a user tries to use @channel to message a large number of teammates across multiple time zones in Slack, they’ll see a cartoon rooster (below) asking them to think twice about notifying these people. It’s a detail that wasn’t built to move metrics but rather to prevent anxiety for people who would otherwise receive work notifications at odd hours. The rooster icon was chosen to keep the tone playful so that the message sender doesn’t feel ashamed or guilty when they read the warning.This type of product detail can mean a lot to users. When I would review customer tickets at Slack, many of them were positive feedback from people thanking us for the thoughtfulness that the team put into the product. Sometimes people couldn’t even say exactly why they loved Slack—partly because what drew them wasn’t one big feature, but rather the attention to details across the product. I’ve learned that if you remove from your product lots of small annoyances that people deal with on a daily basis, the value you get from doing that adds up to something meaningful.Another lesson I learned from Stewart is to spend time understanding user problems and framing them in a way that sets strong constraints for the team. Many PMs jump into solution-finding before they truly understand the problem. This leads to ineffective solutions, or indecisiveness as their teams struggle to eliminate potential solutions. If you understand why a problem exists and frame it clearly, you will identify enough constraints that only a few solutions will be left, streamlining the decision-making process. For example, in the article Are You Solving the Right Problems?, Thomas Wedell-Wedellsborg gives an example of how two different framings of a problem lead to completely different solutions:This ability to reframe problems and set opinionated constraints is a key skill I’ve seen product thinkers use to drive creative solutions.If, on the other hand, you don’t work at a company with strong product thinkers, look for external mentors and read articles or interviews from people such as Julie Zhuo, Stewart Butterfield, David Lieb, and Rahul Vohra. If you’re able to connect with great product thinkers, here are some sample questions you can ask to better understand their processes and insights:What prompted you to build your product? This will give you a sense of the type of user insights you should be looking for and the process to get them.What were the key decision points along the way?What alternative approaches did you consider? For ambiguous problems, you have to explore multiple approaches before you land on one that works. Understanding the solutions that were discarded, and why, will help you get a sense of how they test hypotheses and make trade-offs.What were surprising insights or results? Knowing when their initial hypotheses were wrong and understanding why can help you uncover great insights.What principles or frameworks helped you navigate the ambiguity? Great product thinkers internalize product principles they use to evaluate solutions. If you can uncover those principles, you can use them to guide your decisions as well.Gaining access to strong product thinkers may be difficult, but try to read as many blog posts or watch as many videos as you can where product leaders who you look up to share their thought processes.4. Be curious about changes in technology and your domain📱Another practice for developing creativity is to spend time learning about emerging trends in technology, society, and regulations. Changes in the industry create opportunities for launching new products that can address user needs in new ways. As a PM, you want to understand what’s possible in your domain in order to come up with creative solutions. For example:Cash App decided to support Bitcoin transactions, and as a result, 76% (nearly $4.6 billion) of its 2020 revenues came from Bitcoin. For more examples of products that benefited from new trends, see Lenny’s article Why now.Uber became possible because of the proliferation of smartphones with GPS capabilities and the availability of Google Maps APIs.Clubhouse took off quickly because of the pandemic, which accelerated the need for virtual public discourse.There are two levels at which you can look at emerging trends: the macro and the micro. At the macro level, you should keep track of important platform shifts (e.g. web3, AR/VR, AI), social shifts (e.g. the shift to remote work), and changes in regulations (e.g. new privacy protection laws). It’s important to keep an open mind about new technologies, because at first they receive a lot of skepticism and have obvious flaws. I still remember when people were skeptical of e-commerce and assumed it would never be safe to use credit cards online. When you see a new trend, instead of dismissing it as a fad, ask yourself, “If this trend reaches its full potential, what opportunities will it create that I can pursue?”There are many places to keep up with macro technology trends. For example, you can:Watch annual developer conferences from major tech companies to understand what areas they see as promising (e.g. Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon).Read commentary from industry analysts (e.g. Ben Thompson).Follow tech founders and investors on Twitter (e.g. Naval Ravikant, Elad Gil, Balaji Srinivasan) and pay attention to trends they’re bullish on.Invest in or advise startups operating in spaces that interest you. If that’s not possible, pay attention to what companies top VCs are investing in, and follow those companies.While the macro trends are helpful in seeing where the industry is going, many of the non-obvious opportunities lie in deeply understanding micro changes that may unlock new possibilities. For example, Figma’s high-quality browser-based application for designers became possible only once WebGL became performant enough. In order to understand the nuances of micro changes, I recommend meeting with engineers and domain experts and going deep with them on topics of interest, such as new APIs or platform capabilities.As Paul Graham said in How to Get Startup Ideas, “Live in the future, then build what’s missing.” Living in the future is also an effective approach to developing your product sense.How to tell if you’re getting better at product sense 📈Developing product sense takes time and practice. As you get better at it, you’ll:Notice subtle things about products and people that you would have missed before (e.g. micro frustrations and delights)Anticipate non-obvious user problems when you look at product experiences or before you present at product reviewsDevelop higher-quality hypotheses about product experiences to build, even in the face of ambiguityContribute more unique insights to your team, given your improved understanding of users and the landscapeBe right more often than not about what impact a change to a flow has on metricsAnd, potentially, receive comments from your design partner on how impressed they are with a detail you noticedI hope you decide to invest in developing your product sense, and that the practices in this article, on strengthening empathy and creativity, are as useful to you as they’ve been to me.Helpful resources 🙏🏾The First Secret of Great Design: 16-minute TED talk with Tony Fadell about how keeping a beginner’s mind led to the creation of NestInspired: Book by Marty Cagan about creating products people loveIntro to the Design of Everyday Things: Two-week course with Don Norman on applying design principlesThanks to Lenny for the opportunity to contribute to this newsletter.

I’m Lenny, and each week I tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out at the office.Q: What do you consider GOOD and GREAT retention?“Great retention is the scalable way to grow a product. It’s the best indicator of product-market fit, it is the most important factor in a user’s lifetime value, and high retention drives all of the best acquisition strategies. It’s growth’s equivalent of the triple word score.”—Casey WintersAlthough retention is widely considered to be the most important metric to get right when building (and investing in) a business, it’s also one of the least understood. Why? Because unless you’re a growth expert or an experienced investor, you’re often relying on anecdotes, dated blog posts, and misguided benchmarks. I ran into this problem myself many times when working with startups.So when Casey Winters (former head of growth at Pinterest and Grubhub, and now CPO at Eventbrite) brought up this question in a conversation we were having, we decided to take the opportunity to do some new research. Together, we reached out to 20 of the most experienced growth practitioners we know and asked them two simple questions:What do you consider GOOD and GREAT user retention (at 6 months)?What do you consider GOOD and GREAT net revenue retention (at 12 months)?Taking these insights and combining them with available public data, we’ve come up with a set of concrete recommendations for GOOD and GREAT retention across most types of businesses. Below you’ll find a visual summary of these conclusions, along with detailed recommendations from each of the experts, and public comps from many of today’s biggest companies.As a companion to this post, Casey also published an essay delving into ways to increase retention, among other topics, that you should definitely check out.Without further ado, let’s dive in.What is GOOD and GREAT retention?GOOD and GREAT user retentionConsumer social: ~25% is GOOD, ~45% is GREATConsumer transactional:  ~30% is GOOD, ~50% is GREATConsumer SaaS: ~40% is GOOD, ~70% is GREATSMB/mid-market SaaS: ~60% is GOOD, ~80% is GREATEnterprise SaaS: ~70% is GOOD, ~90% is GREATGOOD and GREAT net revenue retentionConsumer SaaS: ~55% is GOOD, ~80% is GREATBottom-up SaaS: ~100% is GOOD, ~120% is GREATLand and expand VSB SaaS: ~80% is GOOD, ~100% is GREATLand and expand SMB/mid-market SaaS: ~90% is GOOD, ~110% is GREATEnterprise SaaS: ~110% is GOOD, ~130% is GREATHere’s a handy visual guide, which links to a high-res PDF:Big thank-you to the expertsAdam Fishman (Patreon, Imperfect Foods), Andrew Chen (Uber, a16z), Andy Johns (Twitter, Facebook, Wealthfront), Brian Balfour (Reforge), Brian Rothenberg (Eventbrite, TaskRabbit), ChenLi Wang (Dropbox), Dan Hockenmaier (Thumbtack), Elena Verna (SurveyMonkey, Miro), Fareed Mosavat (Slack), Jamie Quint (Notion, Reddit), Jeff Chang (Pinterest), Julie Zhou (Hipmunk, Yik Yak, AdRoll), Kevin Kwok (Greylock), Li Jin (a16z), Merci Grace (Slack), Mike Duboe (Stitch Fix, Greylock), Naomi Ionita (Evernote, Menlo Ventures), Nick Soman (Gusto, Decent), Sarah Guo (Greylock), Shaun Clowes (Atlassian, MuleSoft), and Yuriy Timen (Grammarly). And, of course, my incredible partner on this research, Casey Winters.Disclaimer: Why it may be OK for your retention to be lowTo some, these retention benchmarks will seem high. This is because the bar to build a massively successful business is high. Frankly, it’s why most startups fail. However, although retention is an important metric to get right, it doesn’t live in a vacuum. There are cases when a lower retention rate is OK:You’re just starting out: Don’t despair if you don’t see this level of retention immediately. Use these benchmarks as a guide to prioritize between retention versus acquisition, and read Casey’s post for three ways to approach increasing retention. But just know, startups rarely increase retention significantly.You have low CAC and marginal costs: Growth is a balancing act between CAC, retention, and unit economics. If you can acquire new users cheaply (e.g. SEO, word of mouth, or virality), you can afford to lose more users. This thread by Dan Hockenmaier explains why low retention for businesses like Shopify and Twitter is OK. You’re not building a venture-scale business: These benchmarks are coming from people who helped build iconic, massively scalable businesses. This level of retention is not required for product-market fit or to build a sustainable business. Though the upside will be limited, a flat retention curve that drives a scalable acquisition strategy is enough to keep your business alive.Ultimately, what matters is that your retention supports sustained growth. —Fareed MosavatNow let’s get into the details.1. What is good user retention?Let’s define user retention as the percentage of users who signed up and are still active (i.e. using the product, making a purchase, posting a photo) six months later.Consumer social: ~25% is GOOD, ~45% is GREATThis includes companies such as Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram that are free to use and are generally supported by advertising.

What is good net revenue retention?Let’s define net revenue retention as a company’s monthly recurring revenue (MRR) one year ago divided into the current month’s MRR from that same group of customers. Essentially, how much revenue are you driving from one cohort of customers over time?You’ll notice this section has slightly different categories from the previous section. This is because of the way the customers a business sells to impacts revenue retention (unlike user retention). For example, the network effects in bottom-up SaaS often drive up retention, while the involuntary churn of very small businesses (VSB) is common because many go out of business, and land-and-expand models increase revenue per user in ways that can make up for high user churn.Now let’s look at what good and great net revenue retention looks like for each type of business.Consumer SaaS: ~55% is GOOD, ~80% is GREATThis includes companies such as Netflix, Spotify, and Hulu that sell a monthly/yearly subscription to consumers.

Each week I tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out about work. Send me your questions and in return I’ll humbly offer actionable real-talk advice.Q: What is a good monthly churn for a SaaS business?Look, I made a meme.You could even argue that churn is both a leading cause of business death and the biggest tax on your growth 🤣As Ben points out, churn is unavoidable. So what to do? Beyond constantly working to reduce churn, it’s essential that you understand what healthy monthly churn looks like for your type of business—so that you know if you’re on track for 🚀 or ☠️Though you should generally spend your time focusing on cohort retention and net revenue retention instead of monthly churn—because monthly churn blends new and existing users and hides what’s really going on long-term—it’s still a powerful metric, because it’s quick (you don’t have to wait for cohort curves to flatten), it’s easy (every dashboard has this), and, most interestingly, it tells you how many new users you need to bring in each month in order to continue to grow. Losing 2% of users each month? Grow by over 2% and you’re 📈Depressingly, your monthly churn stat also tells you how quickly you’ll churn through your users if you do nothing. For example, with an 8% monthly churn, you’ll lose almost two-thirds of your users each year 😵‍💫 Even with a 4% monthly churn, you’re rebuilding a third of your users base year after year. This is why SaaS businesses with revenue expansion (i.e. negative churn) are so sought-after.But again, churn is normal and unavoidable. Step one is understanding what healthy (vs. deathly) churn looks like for your business.What is GOOD and GREAT monthly churnTo come up with a benchmark, I came at it from two directions:I reached out to all the smartest growth people I know and asked them what they consider GOOD and GREAT monthly churn when advising and investing in companies.I asked Patrick Campbell, the founder and CEO of ProfitWell, to dig into his treasure trove of data (13,000 anonymized SaaS companies), to see what monthly churn real companies are seeing.After hearing from the experts, and looking at Patrick’s data on the top percentile of SaaS companies, clear answers emerged:For B2C SaaS: Between 3% and 5% monthly churn is GOOD, and less than 2% is GREATFor B2B SMB + Mid-Market: Between 2.5% and 5% is GOOD, and less than 1.5% is GREATFor B2B Enterprise: Between 1% and 2% is GOOD, and less than 0.5% is GREATDefinitionsB2C SaaS: Subscription products sold to consumers; e.g. Duolingo, Spotify, GrammarlyB2B SMB + Mid-Market: Subscription products sold primarily to companies with fewer than 1,000 employees, generally charging less than $1K per month for the average customer; e.g. Gusto, Intercom, Airtable, AsanaB2B Enterprise: Roughly defined as subscription products sold primarily to companies with more than 1,000 employees, generally charging more than $5K per month for the average customer; e.g. Salesforce, Snowflake, Workday, ADPDisclaimers and adviceThis metric is looking at the steady state of churn. New user churn in the first month is always the steepest, normally ranges from 5% to 50%, and happens for a number of reasons.“You can often attribute month 1-3 churn to be failure of activation/onboarding. This can vary a lot across companies, and even within the same company by channel and funnel. For businesses with paid user acquisition, the other factor is acquiring the wrong kind of customer. I’ve told more than one company: Hey, if you just cut your paid marketing by half, I bet your churn will go down!”—ChenLi Wang, ex-growth at DropboxAs you grow, long-term, expect monthly churn to go down.“Monthly churn on subscriber base decreases with age of the business as long-haul subs pull that number down.”—Elena Verna, growth at Netlify, ex- at Miro, SurveyMonkeyIn a B2B SaaS business, net revenue retention is a more important metric than monthly churn.“In SMB/Mid-Market SaaS especially, revenue retention is much more important than customer retention.For example, in the Shopify ecosystem, SaaS players will inevitably see ‘unavoidable churn’ due to shorter lifespan of smaller merchants. This is inherent to the Shopify model. I’ve seen the expansion for many commerce SaaS products look great as merchants grow/graduate to Shopify Plus. Net revenue retention can look very healthy even with low logo retention in these businesses.”—Mike Duboe, ex-growth at Stitch Fix, TiltFor B2C SaaS, you’ll want to focus primarily on cohort-based retention.“I would only look at monthly churn to see how much you need to maintain new user acquisition to keep up growth. Other than that, you should look at it by cohort basis.”—Yuriy Timen, ex-growth at Grammarly, Airtable, CanvaMake sure to break churn down into its component parts.“Churn should always be modeled between (1) intentional and involuntary churn and (2) soft and hard churn:1. Intentional churn is when a user willingly decides to stop using the product. Where I see companies losing meaningful percentage points is in overlooking involuntary churn—good data instrumentation can flag these events, like credit card declined, forgot password, connection errors.2. If users stop using the product but are still paying for it (whether annually or monthly recurring), that’s soft churn and should be a concern where value extraction is greater than value generation.”—Crystal Widjaja, CPO at Kumu, ex-growth at GojekAnd finally, a healthy churn rate is highly dependent on your price point.“The higher the price point, the lower you should expect the target churn.”—Adam Grenier, VP Marketing at MasterClass, ex-UberThis last point is really important, so let’s explore it further.What is GOOD and GREAT monthly churn, by price pointWhy would churn be highly correlated with price? Two reasons:Customer type: The cheaper your product, the smaller the businesses you’re likely selling to—and the smaller the businesses, the more likely they are to go out of business, change their minds, or switch to a competitor.Unit economics: If it’s costing you thousands of dollars to close a deal, you won’t survive if too many of those customers churn. And so companies with a high price point don’t last long if churn is too high.To understand healthy monthly churn by price point (i.e. how much you charge each customer on average per month), Patrick sliced and diced the data, and with input from the experts, this is what we found:"},{"title":"What is a good payback period?","article":"👋 Hey, Lenny here! Welcome to a 🔒 subscriber-only edition 🔒 of my weekly newsletter. Each week I tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out about work. Send me your questions and in return I’ll humbly offer actionable real-talk advice.Q: What is a good payback period?To answer this question, like I did with our look at retention, I brought out the big guns. I polled the smartest growth people I could get hold of and asked them what payback periods they expect when investing in, or advising, startups. Everything that you find below is based on the collective wisdom of these superstars: Adam Grenier, Andrew Chen, Andy Johns, Bill Trenchard, Brian Rothenberg, Casey Winters, ChenLi Wang, Dan Hockenmaier, Darius Contractor, Elena Verna, Jamie Quint, Josh Buckley, Mike Duboe, Naomi Ionita, Sriram Krishnan, and Yuriy Timen 🔥What is a good payback period?Broadly, the consensus is:For B2C businesses, a payback period of less than 1 month is GREAT, 6 months is GOOD, and 12 months is OK. And the exceptional cases can pay back their acquisition costs on the first transaction.For B2B businesses selling to SMBs, less than 6 months is GREAT, 12 months is GOOD, and 18 months is OK. And similarly, the exceptional cases get their customers to prepay their contract and recoup all acquisition costs up-front.For B2B businesses selling to enterprises, less than 12 months is GREAT, 18 months is GOOD, and 24 months is OK. The exceptional cases can pay back their acquisition costs within 6 months.Here’s a handy chart summarizing the findings:What exactly is payback period?The payback period is the amount of time that it takes to earn back the cost of acquiring a new customer. For example, if it costs you $100 to acquire a new customer (e.g. running FB ads) and you make $25 per month from that customer, your payback period is four months.How do you calculate payback period?To calculate your payback period, simply divide your CAC by your gross profit:The biggest mistake founders make when calculating their payback period is looking at revenue, without subtracting the cost of good sold (i.e. margin):“If a startup acquires a customer for $100, and that customer generates $10/mo in revenue, with 80% gross margins (or $8 of monthly gross profit), the payback period on a gross profit basis is $100/$8 = 12.5 months. Not 10 months, if you were just looking at revenue. As my former CFO used to say, ‘Revenue doesn’t pay our salaries—gross profit does.’ You have to take out the cost of goods sold, and many people do not.”—Brian RothenbergAlso:“Including brand search in your paid campaigns bucket will lower your payback period, and I’d consider that cheating.”—Elena VernaWhy is tracking payback period important?The shorter your payback period, the more quickly you can reinvest your cash into growth, and the faster you’ll grow. If, for example, you spend $100,000 on growth and get paid back in three months, while your competitor takes six months, you’ll be able to spend twice as much money on growth without having to raise one additional dollar.Increasingly, startups are focusing on payback periods over LTV/CAC ratios because accurately calculating LTV for an early-stage company is highly suspect. This is the same reason you don’t want long payback periods for early-stage companies:“The way I think about it is the more data you have about your customers over time, the better you can predict actual lifetime value. An early-stage startup has very little data, so if it has a long payback period, it’s not guaranteed there will be a timeline that pays off at all due to all the assumptions. A late-stage company has over a decade of cohorts it can compare new customers to, to predict what they will look like in six months, one year, two years, etc.”—Casey WintersAre higher payback periods OK?Yes! There are a handful of cases where having a higher payback period is actually a good thing.1. When you can confidently predict your LTV“It is important to remember that what really matters is the ultimate LTV of the customer. If your product is incredibly sticky (i.e. more than 5-year LTV) or shows high growth in account (through additional usage fees/upsell/cross-sell), an 18-month payback period may be really good.”—Bill Trenchard“Generally it’s the case with larger companies to have payback periods of 18 to 24 months. These are companies with large balance sheets, that can float it, in more competitive categories. They generally have a lot of data on their LTV curve and how it performs over time.”—Josh Buckley2. When you’re a mature business and can think longer-term“In some cases, with mature enterprise SaaS businesses that have predictable LTVs and renewal data, as well as multi-year contracts, I’ve seen payback periods stretch as far as 24 months.”—Yuriy Timen“At different stages of maturity (5+ years, 10+ years), you can probably shift the OK, Good, Great designations from the summary above up one level because you have more confidence in the lifetime value and therefore the payback. Usually you have more cash as well. In those cases, let’s say a consumer business that is 10 years in and getting payback in one month, it should really be trying to grow more aggressively by extending its payback period, probably leaving a lot of profitable growth on the table by staying at one month.”—Casey Winters3. When you’re optimizing for growth“I’ve seen payback periods as high as 5 to 7 years. There are good reasons a company might tolerate that, such as much-needed fuel into a growth loop, it’s an investment into key target market segment, or it’s just early inefficiency that will take some time to optimize. Not every channel comes out of the gate with good payback period, after all.”—Elena Verna“The payback period you choose to target is highly contingent on the stage of the business and how quickly you are trying to grow. Lower payback periods are not objectively optimal, because they may mean you’re leaving growth on the table.”—Dan Hockenmaier“So much of it depends on how one is maximizing revenue vs. profit. The same company could be 8 months if it was profit-focused or 24 months if revenue-focused, and feel good about each.”—Darius Contractor"},{"title":"What is a good activation rate","article":"👋 Hey, Lenny here! Welcome to this month’s ✨ free edition ✨ of Lenny’s Newsletter.

But knowing what a good activation rate is, and how to improve it, has been difficult if not impossible. For that reason, it’s been one of the most frequent questions I’ve received from readers over the years.To finally get you an answer, I teamed up with Yuriy Timen (growth advisor and recent podcast guest) to run a global benchmarking survey, asking readers to contribute their activation rate and what they’ve learned about increasing it. We exceeded our expectations and ended up with over 500 responses, which I believe is the largest survey of its kind. Here’s a sampling of products represented in this survey:Below, you’ll find GOOD and GREAT activation rates (by product type), the most common ways to increase activation rates, examples of great activation milestones, and a bunch of advice for setting and improving your activation rates.We did our best to analyze this data and draw conclusions, but I’m confident we missed something. If you find anything amiss, please let us know by leaving a comment. We’ll integrate feedback and update the post with any additional learnings 👇Leave a commentAnd finally, if you filled out our survey and shared your activation rates with us, you should have received an email with a link to the raw survey data. If you didn’t get that email, please let us know and we’ll get it right over to you. If you missed the boat and didn’t contribute to the survey but still want to see the raw results, at the end of this post there’s a second opportunity.Let’s get into it.1. What is activation rate?Your activation rate is the percentage of your new users who hit your activation milestone. Concretely:activation rate = [users who hit your activation milestone] / [users who completed your signup flow].Your activation milestone (often referred to as your “aha moment”) is the earliest point in your onboarding flow that, by showing your product’s value, is predictive of long-term retention. A user is typically considered activated when they reach this milestone. A good activation event is often associated with the beginnings of a user forming a new habit inside the product, and since increasing activation rate is one of the best levers for increasing retention, it’s often a major focus for growth teams.2. What are examples of activation milestones?A good activation metric should be two things:Highly predictive: It should be predictive of long-term value delivery to the user, which often manifests itself in long-term retention, monetization, or both. Users who hit your activation milestone should retain at a rate at least 2x better than those who do not complete the activation step.Highly actionable: The metric needs to be something growth teams can directly impact. For example, for a multi-user SaaS products (e.g. Figma), teams often set their activation metrics on workspace- or account-level actions (e.g. “workspace with 10 items created and 2+ active editors by W4”) vs. a user taking action. You can’t make a workspace or an account do anything—only users can.In the survey, we looked at activation rates by eight product types:B2B enterprise SaaS (e.g. Salesforce, Workday)B2B prosumer SaaS (e.g. Figma, Slack)B2C freemium/subscription (e.g. Duolingo, Calm)B2C free/ads (e.g. Snap, Instagram)B2C marketplace (e.g. Airbnb, eBay)B2B marketplace (e.g. Faire)E-commerce (e.g. Chewy, Wish)DTC subscription (e.g. Hims, Athletic Greens)Below are some of the most common activation milestones, categorized by product type:A few of our favorite examples of activation milestones:First day of food and weight loggedFirst 5 survey responses collectedFirst design published and sharedFirst video created that received a viewFirst listen to more than 40% of a trackFirst listen to 3+ sessions in the first weekFirst time booked listingFirst moved meetingFirst job application sent10 posts published in first 2 weeksBelow we’ll share the most common mistakes when setting your activation milestone, but by far the most common mistake is to set the activation point too early or too late. Too early would be simply finishing the sign-up process for a SaaS product, and too late would be three purchases in a marketplace or e-commerce site.Activation is meant to be a leading indicator of a new user sticking around and becoming a customer—not the act of becoming a long-term customer. It’s meant to be something your team can do to increase retention, and defining activation as either sign-up or multiple purchases defies the purpose behind an activation metric.3. What is a good activation rate?Based on our survey results, broadly, the average activation rate is 34%, and the median activation rate is 25%. For just SaaS products (removing marketplaces, e-commerce, and DTC), the average activation rate is 36%, and the median is 30%.Here’s what activation rates look like by individual product types:We consider being in the 60th percentile a GOOD activation rate, and being in the 80th percentile a GREAT activation rateWhy such variance in activation rates?Mostly due to the milestone definition, and how much effort it takes to get there. For example, marketplaces and e-commerce companies have the lowest activation rates because they generally define their activation milestone as the first transaction (i.e. spending money). B2C freemium products have the highest activation rate because their typical activation milestone is low-friction (e.g. starting a meditation session, logging a meal, listening to a music track).4. What are the most common ways to increase activation?In our survey, we asked, “If you’ve had success improving activation rate, what change has had the biggest impact?”Here are the eight most commonly referenced tactics:Simpler onboarding UI/UXReducing onboarding frictionEmails and follow-up commsOptimizing copySmarter top-of-funnel targetingSales outreachAdding incentivesShowing value earlierHere are direct quotes from survey responders sharing what most helped them increase their activation rate:i. Simpler onboarding UI/UX“Removing distracting CTAs between sign-up event and activation event”“Hiding a confusing button on home page for new users”“Simplifying the flow”“Simplify setup process”“Simplify the flow to make a first booking”“Changed the flow to have fewer steps and improved it 20%”“Reducing number of steps”“Removing unnecessary steps, calming anxieties at each stage”“Break down the core steps to simplify booking flow”“Reducing the number of steps during onboarding”“Reduce steps to onboarding flow”“Reducing the steps required in the onboarding flow”“Reducing multiple steps in onboarding flow”“Reducing steps in the onboard flow”“Shorten funnel”“Shorten steps”“Simplifying the onboarding process and requirements”“Focused onboarding—improving relevance of the features we expose to the customer”“Driving all attention into one seeded task for guided completion”“Order of how tasks are presented made the biggest difference”“Breaking down the learning curve to 3-4 actionable steps and guiding them through it in the product”“Simple, mobile-optimized sign-up flow”“Don’t allow the user to do anything before the group is created”ii.

What are the most common mistakes people make when setting their activation milestone?Too early: Often companies define activation as simply completing the sign-up flow, which alone is unlikely to show a user the value of your product, and thus is unlikely to be predictive of long-term retention.Too late: Marketplaces and e-commerce startups often mistakenly consider “activated” to be when users make multiple purchases. Your activation milestone should be a leading indicator of having built a habit, not having proven the habit.Not predictive: Selecting an activation metric that’s not highly predictive (i.e. at least 2x) of long-term retention and/or monetization.Not actionable: Selecting an activation metric that’s not easily actionable (e.g. see workspace example above), measurable (e.g. using an offline event that digital growth teams can’t impact), or hard to experiment with (e.g. takes three months to get any data).Too complicated: Selecting a multi-stage activation event with multiple different user actions, along with a time bound, where a simpler definition would give you most of the predictability you get with the overly complex definition.6. What percentage of companies have a time-bound activation definition?Based on our results, about 6% of respondents had time-bound activation, with a median of 10 days and a mode of 7 days. We believe, however, that this is far undercounting the reality, as we didn’t specifically ask about it.Also, about 10% of respondents have a two-part milestone (e.g. get 2+ bookings within 7-day time frame; share 3 documents in 90 days).7. How do you determine your activation milestone, and make sure it’s causally linked to new-user retention rather than just correlated?Initially, your selected activation event will be hypothesis-driven and hence only correlative to longer-term retention and/or monetization. That’s OK. Take your best shot. It is only through structured experimentation that you will be able to tell if there is a causal relationship between your activation metric and longer-term value extraction.Specifically, you would run a series of experiments geared at improving your activation metric. As you accumulate winners, you will monitor your later-stage metric to see if they uptick as well. If so, you have proven out causality. If not, you have the arduous task before you of going back to the drawing board and iterating on your definition of an activation metric.Our advice is to not overthink it—pick a milestone that’s relatively early in a new user’s lifecycle that strongly correlates with long-term retention. Then just go. Facebook’s classic activation milestone is a great example of this bias toward action, as shared by Adriel Frederick:Bonus ask: How did you come up with your activation milestone?We’re curious what level of analysis teams have done to determine their activation milestone.

Each week I tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out about work.SubscribeQ: Learned a lot from your post on what is a good activation rate. But can you dive deeper into how to quantitatively determine your activation milestone? I’m building a multi-player B2B SaaS product.In our post on activation rate (which is currently the fourth most popular post of all time 😮), Yuriy and I shared examples of activation milestones across hundreds of companies. But we didn’t get very concrete about how to go about nailing down your actual activation metrics. So I thought I’d do a follow-up post on this.Below, I’ll share a three-step process for finding your activation metric, with real-life examples from a dozen companies. As a bonus, I’ll expand on activation milestones for multi-player SaaS products with help from Merci Grace (former Head of Growth at Slack), Lauryn Isford (Head of Growth at Airtable), Karri Saarinen (CEO of Linear), Ben Williams (VP of Product at Snyk), Badrul Farooqi (first PM at Figma), Jackie Bavaro (first PM at Asana), and Rachel Wang (Product Lead at Sprig). As always, if you have any feedback, additional suggestions, or questions, just leave a comment 👇Leave a commentThank you to Yuriy for reviewing this post, and to everyone who shared their stories 🙏How to determine your activation metric Follow this three-step process:Brainstorm, and explore your product usage data, for some potential “aha” moments in the user journey.Run a regression analysis to see if there’s an inflection in retention when someone hits any of those moments, to establish a correlative relationship between some potential activation milestones and product retention.Run some experiments to see if increasing the percentage of users hitting that moment increases their retention rate, to see if any of those correlative relationships translate into true causality. A good activation metric is causal for your retention, not just correlative.Here are six real stories from readers putting this process into action:“For our new products with little or no usage data:We conducted in-depth interviews with our target segment and asked them, ‘What are the signals that this product is solving your problem?’We brainstormed a list of actions that reflect those signals.We ran a quantitative survey targeting the target segment, showing the list of actions and asking respondents, ‘Which of the following is the first moment that you feel that this product solves your problem?’We then picked the milestone that had been selected by the majority.For existing products with a lot of historical data, we started with steps one and two above, but after that, we ran regression analyses to find which action completion correlated with long-term retention (30 days in our case).”“We have a lot of qualitative data from our users because we do interviews on a weekly basis with them. So when we asked this question, we already knew about some candidates for the activation milestone.We focused on when the users were getting value from our product. Then, once we had some candidates, we used data to see which of them were correlated with long-term retention. Mark Roberge has a really good process on how to do this.After we saw some results, we just went with the one that ‘felt’ the best. That’s because we don’t have too much data. Around 300 customers. So we know there could be a lot of errors in the numbers, so we thought we shouldn’t do a decision based solely on data if the results were similar.”“Building [a top-five e-commerce site’s] self-checkout product, we looked at retention rates across customer segments that completed various tasks successfully, for example:Scanning an itemCompleting a checkoutPlacing 1, 2, 3, n orders per month We noticed that completing a transaction was the best indicator of long-term retention. Particularly, customers who placed at least two orders retained at a 2x higher rate than with one order. So that became our activation milestone.”“I work in B2B enterprise SaaS with a multi-use-case complex product. We don’t have enough data to conduct a causal analysis with conversion. Therefore, we broke down our product into three main JTBDs that prospects come to us for, as well as required behaviors that need to be set up in order to use the workspace successfully (e.g. import your data). For each of these areas, we conducted an analysis to see what events correlated most with trial retention (two weeks). We evaluated what the strongest correlations were and chose activation metrics for each area.”“We initially focused mostly on qualitative insights to determine this milestone for our customer survey product—interviewing participants, doing guided onboardings and product demos, reviewing Hotjar recordings.We learned that our ‘aha!’ moment occurs when they discover the analysis and automations that are possible with their results—and they can only find that once they’ve got at least one survey participant. So that became our activation milestone: getting you first survey responses. This gave us an easy-to-measure metric that allows us to focus on building and optimizing rather than tweaking our data forever.”“First we selected a few candidates from the early stages of the user journey. Then we tried to validate each by looking at how they could have affected retention in Amplitude. We came up with the final decision and are still examining if we are right about this metric.”How readers tactically correlate a milestone to retention:"},{"title":"How to measure cohort retention","article":"👋 Hey, Lenny here! Welcome to this month’s ✨ free edition ✨ of my newsletter. Each week I humbly tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out about work.If you’re not a subscriber, here’s what you missed this month:All the ways to grow your productHow to kickstart and scale a consumer business—Step 5: Finding product-market fitKickstarting and scaling a consumer business—Step 6: Building your growth engineSubscribe to get access to these posts, and every post.SubscribeQ: You talk about retention a lot, but how do I actually measure retention? Specifically, cohort retention. I haven’t found any great guides out there.I was also shocked to find that there wasn’t a great post out there on how to accurately and concretely measure cohort retention. Considering how important it is to all things product and growth—and how costly it is to get it wrong—this is a big gap. So let’s fix it.To help us out, I’ve tapped Olga Berezovsky, author of the wonderful Data Analysis Journal newsletter, to get deep into the weeds of retention. Below, she shares the formulas, SQL queries, tools, and templates you need to measure, visualize, and report on retention. I’ve never seen this level of detail and guidance before, and I’m excited to share it here. Thank you, Olga! And enjoy!You can follow Olga on LinkedIn and Twitter, and subscribe to her newsletter here.Many analysts (and product managers, founders, and most people) are intimidated by retention. The graphs can be difficult to read, the definitions vary for each product and business type, and the SQL is complex. At the same time, retention is both the most important and the least understood metric at most companies. In my experience, it takes up to six months to nail accurate retention reporting.On every team I was a part of over my 10+ year tenure as an analyst, I would continually work on our retention reporting. As one example, at Change.org, I was part of the Petition Starters squad, and by monitoring and slicing the Day 7 and Day 30 retention of users who started petitions, we grew “petition starters per day” (our KPI) by 450%. Each new petition generated new signatures, which helped us grow to over 450 million active users. Similarly, at MyFitnessPal (where I work now), Day 1 and Day 7 retention are closely monitored for every product initiative.In this post, I’ll share the methods, tools, and strategies I’ve developed over the years to help you calculate cohort retention and understand the nuances of reporting on retention. For a primer on retention, make sure to read two of Lenny’s previous posts on the topic, How to increase your retention and What is good retention, to get an introduction and learn why it’s important to monitor and grow retention.To recap, retention measures the ability of your product to keep users active over time. Retention for consumer businesses would have a different meaning than for enterprise, B2B, or B2C companies:Step 1. Define “active”As you can see above, a fundamental variable in calculating retention for most products is “active users.” But it’s not obvious what “active” means.Below are the most common events used to define “active” across companies. Each of these events has its own downsides and limitations:Visit: Too broad; you will overcount users, most likely having a challenge with unauthenticated and not registered users. Only relevant for the web.Session starts: You’ll possibly overcount users by pulling in unauthenticated IDs. You will also need to limit the session length to a specific time range that should be unique to your product usage. If you don’t do this, you are likely to count background app refreshes, notifications, and any other app activity that is not related to user activity (read more: This Is Why You Overcount Your Daily Active Users). Login or app opens: Same as above, as you will need a way to exclude new users with their first app open event for cohorted retention and exclude unauthenticated users and duplicates.Web page views or screen views: Too broad; most likely will pull in all user types (dormant, lapsers, new users) into one bucket and over-report both DAU and retention. Main user action (e.g. item view, search, log an exercise, transaction, etc.): Too narrow, and easy to miss active users who don’t do the main activity you expect but keep using the app (adjacent users case), or they make a transaction from a different platform (app/web).At different companies, I had to report DAU and retention based on all these event variations, sometimes even mixing a few of them together (session start + app open + main transaction). Most companies use logins or app opens as main events for the “active users” definition. But given that I always aim for the cleanest and most precise data reporting, I’d recommend using the main user action as the activity event, for example:Pros to this approach: It ignores all the “noise” events, like visits, screen views, and logins, and tailors the activity event to only the main transaction or event that you expect a user most commonly does.It gives you the cleanest sample of truly active users, whose behavior you can monitor and validate.It is usually available across all platforms (unlike app open or visits) and data sources, making it easily accessible for reporting and monitoring.Regardless of your business type, my recommendation is to use the main user action to monitor not only retention but other user activity metrics like DAU, WAU, MAU, and DAU/MAU ratio. Step 2. Differentiate users from customersOnce your team agrees on what “active” means for your product, the next step is to segment your active users into free vs. paid. Your retention will have a different logic for each of these groups.“A customer is defined as the person/group who is paying you. A user is a person using the product. In subscription products, oftentimes there are multiple users associated with a single customer. Or people are users before they are customers. You need to separate the definition and language between these two things for teams to clearly act on them.” —Brian Balfour, “Common Mistakes in Defining Metrics”Depending on your business model, your retention output will be built on a different metric input, for example:These metrics are your baseline for calculating retention. Now that you know who your active user or active customer is (e.g. a paid user who logged an exercise or a free user who read an article), you can start building retention to learn how often they come back. Often a mistake I see SaaS companies make is reporting one “blended” retention, with a mix of free and paid users. This can be misleading, because users who pay for the product are likely to use it way more than free users. So the true activity of free users (and your “pool of opportunity” to convert) will be hidden.Step 3. Pick your retention typeThe next step in calculating retention is setting your timeline. As a team, you have to agree on what retention reporting type you should adopt:X-day retentionUnbounded (rolling) retention The method you choose will significantly affect your results.1. X-day retentionX-day (also known as N-day or bounded) tells you the percentage of users who come back on a specific day. For example, for all users who join, what percentage return to your app on exactly day 14:From Amplitude—3 Ways to Measure User RetentionThis is the most conservative retention approach and will return you a lower retention percentage.2. Unbounded retentionUnbounded retention tells you how many of your users got back on a specific day or later. For example, for all new users who joined on a specific day, what percentage of users are using the product after 14 days (and not necessarily on day 14).If your goal is to match retention with your user churn, this is the way to go. The unbounded retention value for month 6 gives you the percentage of users who returned after month 6.So which approach should you use? Both are correct, yet both will return completely different retention data:My general favorite method is unbounded retention because (1) I like my KPIs to be connected, proportional, and correlated to each other, and (2) unbounded retention is the inverse of churn, so it gives me another way to validate and test my data, increasing the confidence in my reporting (the higher the churn, the lower the retention, and vice versa).But you should pick the method that works best for your analytical objective and your users’ natural behavior: If your users use the product regularly (e.g. logging foods every morning, recording exercise, or listening to a podcast daily), use X-day retention.If your KPIs are coded to a specific time range (e.g. 30 days trial, 28 days active, 7 days resubscriber), then you probably want to also count only those users who return to your product within a set period of time and use the X-day method.If you don’t expect users to come back on an average daily/weekly/monthly basis, and the user engagement pattern is more chaotic, then use the unbounded method.    X-day retention is more appropriate for short-term analysis like measuring the onboarding funnel or marketing campaigns. Unbounded retention is more useful for measuring long-term user behavior, especially if you want to segment your users into retention groups (6M, 9M, 1 year, 2 years).  Overall, a rule of thumb in analytics is that if your product is SaaS, you are likely to be tied to a specific time bound (paid subscription length, trial length, etc.). Because of that, it’s recommended to follow X-day retention. If you are not in SaaS but in a B2C or consumer transactional or social business, then you can be more flexible and adopt unbounded retention.Step 4. Reporting retention from BI applications vs. SQL1. Getting retention via product analytics toolsToday’s popular product analytics tools support retention reporting. Each application has its own specifics or limitations. Reporting retention from these tools is doable (and becomes common), assuming you have the right events you need, which often is not the case.To make things easy, Amplitude, Mixpanel, Kissmetrics, Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, and others are integrated via SDK with the client side (browser, app, device) and pass you client data, which is usually user and app activity. While some of these events can be used for retention reporting, others won’t be sufficient. Read more to learn about when to use client-side or server-side events for analytics and why most analytics efforts fail. Often, to make changes to a subscription or a purchase, users are routed from the app to the app store (Apple Store, Google Play, Stripe, PayPal, etc.) to activate a trial, complete a payment, cancel or renew a subscription, etc. That’s why this payment data is likely not available in the app (client) analytics. So you won’t be able to access it in Amplitude or Mixpanel right away. Therefore, for SaaS products (those that report retention based on DAPU or DAC), you might not have the ability to replicate retention in product analytics tools, because they won’t have payment data. This is solvable, and your company might already address it. The common solution here is to load payment data into product analytics tools from a database via Segment or a data pipeline (assuming you already receive this data from a payment provider like Stripe/Apple/PayPal). But if you work for a small startup and are in the early process of setting up reporting and analytics, this is likely not the case. And creating cohorted or even simple retention most likely won’t be doable at this stage. Assuming you have needed events loaded in the product analytics tool, you can read the guidance on how to approach retention graphs in Amplitude, Mixpanel, or Google Analytics.❗Heads-up: Amplitude, Mixpanel, or similar analytics by default report N-day retention. Read more about N-day or unbounded retention differences in Amplitude: 3 Ways to Measure User Retention. If your business is consumer social, you will have to change retention settings and customize it.  ❗❗If you report retention from multiple sources—for example, from Amplitude and also from Tableau, which is sourcing data from a database—it will be very different, because of all the specifics described above: (1) rolling dates/N-day type, (2) different “activity” definition and tracking, and (3) possibly data availability and refresh gaps.  2. Getting retention via SQLThis is one of the common questions for analysts during SQL interviews and often is the first project to work on. It’s a multi-step process requiring a deep understanding of the business objective, a flexible approach, and data intuition.Looking back at all the places I’ve worked, I don’t remember a case where you could come in and quickly run some SQL to cohort your users into the right retention groups. Usually, some work needs to be done to the underlying tables to bring the data to the appropriate format and structure to work with retention. Same with DAU, churn, LTV, anything. First, you work on creating Sessions or Users or an Activity table that serves as a foundation for calculating your KPIs later. This table should have the right timestamp of user activity, event ID, user ID, properties, and measures you need. After the new table is tested, you can then work on creating downstream views for retention, DAU, or anything else. When replicating retention with SQL, it’s easy to go wild and overcomplicate your approach. Follow these steps to stay on track and get the correct retention logic:Step 1: Get the users’ first (initial) action—this is usually sign-up or the first purchaseStep 2: Get the user activity after the sign-up or purchase—based on your activity definitionStep 3: Get the total time in between the initial and consecutive user action (“retained_time”)Step 4: Convert the total time to days/weeks/months as neededStep 5: Group users into buckets based on the total retained time from the previous stepStep 6: Map and order users’ buckets based on their initial action time—sign-up or the first purchaseDepending on your underlying data and table structure, these steps can be done via a simple SELECT statement (like SELECT * FROM ready_to_use_retention_table) or another quick way, such as SELECT \n    snapshot_date\n    , start_date\n    , n_period\n    , COUNT(user_id) AS n_users\nFROM subscriptions \nGROUP BY snapshot_date, start_date, n_monthor via multiple subqueries, self-joins, window functions, or a combination of all of the above. That’s why this is such a good interview question—because, given the input values and the business type/case, your output SQL will be completely different.   Regardless of SQL complexity, your output raw data may look similar to this for simple retention:             And this is the underlying table structure for cohorted retention: Here is a sample SQL to replicate the cohorted table above: WITH new_user_activity AS (\n\n  SELECT \n    a.*\n  FROM activity a\n  JOIN signups s\n    ON s.user_id = a.user_id\n    AND s.signup_date = a.activity_date -- if initial user signup counts as activity. If not, either disregard or s.signup_date = a.activity_date\n)\n\n, active_user_count AS (\n  SELECT \n    activity_date\n    , COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS users_count\n  FROM new_user_activity\n  GROUP BY activity_date\n)\n\n-- for daily retention: \nSELECT \n    n.signup_date AS signup_date\n    , DATEDIFF('DAU', n.signup_date, a.activity_date) AS period\n    , MAX(c.users_count) AS new_users\n    , COUNT(DISTINCT a.user_id) AS retained_users\n    , COUNT(DISTINCT a.user_id) / MAX(c.users_count)::float AS retention\nFROM new_user_activity n\nLEFT JOIN activity a \n  ON n.user_id = a.user_id\n  AND n.signup_date < a.activity_date\n  AND (n.signup_date + interval '30 days') >= a.activity_date -- retention data for the next 30 days after signup\nLEFT JOIN active_user_count c \n  ON n.signup_date = c.activity_date\nGROUP BY 1, 2Find more SQL solutions for retention types here.Step 5. Visualizing retentionOnce you have your SQL working, the next step is to visualize your data. There are many ways to visualize a retention report. I won’t be going into depth here, because the most common data visualization tools (Tableau, Power BI) require meaningful expertise. Same with Mode or Sisence. These tools let you leverage their cohorted graphs, and each format can be grouped by (1) time period (e.g. daily, monthly, annually) and then by (2) user segments (e.g. trialers, resubscribers, power users) to make your analytics really powerful.In Excel, you can leverage pivot tables and replicate the same charts there as well. In the pivot table editor, you can drag the initial activity dates into rows and the retained period into columns. For cohorted charts, it’s recommended to apply a color scale (click on conditional formatting, choose a color scale, then pick a color option). Without color-coding, cohorts are difficult to read.If you are looking for a quick template for a cohorted retention graph, I recommend using Christoph Janz’s cohort analysis template. If you have new customers and their activity dates, you can plug them into his file and get retention calculations.Regarding retention visualization format, quite often I see a line chart or a stacked line chart. Product analytics tools like Amplitude and Mixpanel by default create line charts similar to these:From ChartMogul—SaaS Metrics Refresher #6: Cohort AnalysisFor a KPIs dashboard, it’s a good practice to have a simple summary table with retention stats: The best practice for reporting retention is cohorts:From Braze—The Top 3 Ways to Calculate User Retention Rate with FormulasThis chart shows how many users registered each week and how many of them were retained in each subsequent week. It is filtered to only “New Users.” Additionally, you can segment retention reporting for active users, churned users, inactive users, and reactivated users. That can help you locate your power users and understand what makes them stick. It’s expected that retention for these cohorts will be significantly different. So you should always cohort your users into different behavioral segments if you can. Like I said, your ability to create multiple user cohorts is linearly correlated with how well your analytics is set up.In companies with more advanced data stacks, the product team has the ability to locate, test, iterate, and release new features to only specific user segments. Having these groups cleanly and precisely cohorted also speaks to the maturity of the analytical domain. It takes time to get there, though.📗 Takeaways🤝 Retention measures the ability of your product to keep (1) users (2) active (3) over time.Depending on your business model and type, “users” can mean customers, free users, or free users with a purchase, so retention calculation and definition will be different.“Active” can be a range of activity events, and often you have to pick the event that is available, consistent across your platforms, and clean.“Over time” can be tricky to define—bound to a specific timeline or a rolling average? Pick your X-day or unbounded retention type based on your product usage.📈 Reporting retention from product analytics tools has its own specifics. It’s faster and easier to create a report and slice and dice, but given the analytics setup at your company, it may be limited or lead you further away from the questions you want to answer. 🗄️ Getting retention data via SQL is not straightforward either, and your SQL code will be different depending on your underlying data structure and format. Create the foundation metrics tables first, then work on your SQL from there. 📊 Visualizing retention via cohort graphs is the best practice that gives you the most insights into user behavior patterns.Other things to keep in mindGiven that retention includes so many elements of activity, it’s not the right metric to use for weekly reporting or as a baseline for an A/B test. Too often I have seen how product analytics teams evaluate experimentation against retention and wonder why the increase in user activity doesn’t lead to a change in retention. Because the activity is only one of the components of retention. Retention (like revenue) is the output metric. You should monitor it but not strictly utilize it as a goal for testing or campaigning.Additionally, every new executive who comes in pushes for their own definition and reporting format. Therefore, product analytics should be flexible with the dashboards and data sources to adopt whatever new retention meaning is requested (for example, changing app_open event to login, or 30-day retention calculation to rolling 28 days).  I’ll stop here, but there is much more to retention to cover—the specifics of revenue retention reporting, retention differences between SaaS and B2C or B2B, handling user outliers, working with retention curve patterns, retention growth-rate benchmarks, and more.Thank you for reading!

Below is what I learned.Huge thank-you to the following amazing people for sharing their insights: Alexander Taussig and Arsham Memarzadeh (Lightspeed), Andrew Chen and Olivia Moore (a16z), Arra Malekzadeh (Craft), Caitlin Bolnick Rellas (CRV), Daniel Levine (Accel), Elad Gil, Ellen Chisa (Boldstart), Grace Ge (Menlo), Grant Ebenger (Tiger), John Luttig (Founders Fund), Jonathan Golden (NEA), Kanyi Maqubela (Kindred), Kimberly Tan (a16z), Leo Polovets (Susa), Mike Duboe (Greylock), Mike Vernal (Sequoia), Niko Bonatsos (GC), Nina Achadjian (Index), Patrick Chase (Redpoint), Rebecca Kaden (USV), Sandhya Hegde (Unusual Ventures), and Todd Jackson (First Round) 🙏Takeaways1. In the early stages, investors don’t care about month-over-month growthWhy? Because percentages with a small base don’t mean much. This sentiment was true across every investor I talked to, e.g.:“I look at MoM only really as a proxy for how fast it ramps to $1m ARR.We don’t anchor on the specific percentages for MoM growth because the percentage represents a pretty small dollar difference with small denominators. For example, 10% vs. 20% growth at $100K ARR isn’t substantial. Every percentage means different things in an absolute sense when the denominator is small.Another way of thinking about it through a MoM lens is that we’d want to see accelerating MoM growth (it going from 10% to 12% to 15%, for instance) to see that the company is picking up momentum.”—Kimberly Tan, a16zThat being said, if you’re looking for a month-over-month benchmark below $1m ARR, answers typically fell in the 15%-25% range.2. Instead, for early-stage B2B businesses, investors focus on how quickly they ramp to $1m ARR after going liveAs John Luttig (Founders Fund) put it:“In the early stages it’s mostly about time from launch to your current ARR.If you grew to $500k ARR in 3mo post-launch, that’s more impressive than $1m in 24mo post-launch. Generally, 0 to $1m ARR in 12mo or shorter is great. There are obvious exceptions to this—not every company’s success can be measured in ARR since launch (Figma, OSS, etc.).” Broadly, the expectation is that getting to $1m ARR within a year of launch is GOOD, and getting there in three quarters (9 months) is GREAT.As Sandhya Hegde (Unusual Ventures) said, “You start the growth clock the month you go GA.”Grace Ge (Menlo) shared a similar point:“Velocity is everything post-launch. As the company matures, it’s less about convincing investors to dream the dream and more about proving the dream is real, executable, and monetizable.”For this reason, you want to be strategic about when you launch: “The great irony is that once you start having numbers, investors start to really care what those numbers are.”—Caitlin Bolnick Rellas, CRV“If you’ve launched and have very little traction, it’s worse than being pre-launch, because it shows the market/value prop is already demonstrably weak. This is why no data is better than bad/small data.”—John Luttig, Founders FundHowever, a couple of investors specifically said that they don’t care about how long it takes you to get going, as long as when you do get going, it really gets going:“We’re less concerned about ramp to $1mm of ARR, or growth rates every year after launch. Some of our biggest winners took several years to really get going and find strong PMF. But once they do, we want them to take off. In other words, if a business grew revenues from $500k > $5mm this year, I wouldn’t care whether it was launched 1 or 5 years ago.”And if you get out of the gate slowly, you can sometimes still catch up:“Investors tend to prize early velocity. This makes sense: it increases the likelihood that you will compound to very high revenues. But speed of 0 to $1M of ARR has, in my experience, been less predictive than speed from $500K to $5M ARR. The latter is indicative of having ‘minimum viable durability’ of your revenue, which will compound over a longer period. Oftentimes, during the 0 to $1M phase, a company is still working to optimize retention, experimenting with efficiency, and initially segmenting their customers.”—Kanyi Maqubela, Kindred3. If you don’t have strong immediate ARR growth, you can show success in other waysWithout fast ARR growth, you’ll need to show strong signals that people really want your product—through high retention and efficiency:“Revenue growth is really an output for what else is happening in the business—basically how much customers love the product and how efficient it is to get more of them. Cohorted revenue retention and/or purchase behavior (ideally U-shaped cohorts where net revenue retention goes up over a year) and marketing spend/revenue (efficiency) are the most important factors to the health and velocity of a business.”—Rebecca Kaden, USV“The key thing is that there’s some leading indicator of ARR that is intrinsically compounding at a high rate. It’s often early users with taste representative of future users loving something. For example, if the business is going to be sales-led, are our salespeople incredibly productive (or do I think they will be)? Are sales cycles oddly short, do customers rave about us and tell their friends (typically leading to oddly low CAC), etc.?”And Ellen Chisa (Boldstart) reminds us that in the early days, it’s often a trap to focus too much on growth:“It’s a huge mistake to focus on the growth number before getting retention. You can often hit the ‘great’ number at an early stage by brute force because the numbers are so small. Unfortunately, that won’t translate to continued growth, and then you’ll end up in a worse place than if you’d spent longer to hit the fundamentals.”And the quality of your ARR often matters just as much as your growth rate:“Beyond simply growth, it’s equally important to look at components of ARR (new, retained, expansion, resurrection, contraction, churn) and customer concentration, and be mindful of the sustainability of growth (e.g. how’s sales efficiency and CAC payback? How does new ARR compare to sales and marketing spend?).”—Arra Malekzadeh, Craft4. Along those same lines, for early-stage consumer businesses, it’s all about intensity of engagement, virality, and retention—not revenueFor B2C businesses, early-stage consumer investors look for how intensely people use the product, and share the product, versus revenue growth. For example, Mike Vernal (Sequoia) shared:“For consumer, I focus on engagement and retention first and foremost. >50% DAU/MAU or >50% D30 retention is excellent. If you have both of those, only then do I worry about whether you can grow it.”"},{"title":"Prioritizing","article":"👋 Hello, I’m Lenny, and welcome to a 🔒 subscriber-only edition 🔒 of my weekly newsletter.

Each week I humbly tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out about work. Subscribe today to get each and every issue.SubscribeAs a startup founder, you need to do the impossible. You build something that has never been built before, with a team that’s never worked together before, while learning dozens of new skills, making countless no-going-back decisions, all before you run out of money (and energy). It’s like being lost in the wilderness, in the dark, with only a vague sense of where you’re heading.Imagine if you had a map.From TikTok to Reddit to Uber to Airbnb, I’ve had the opportunity to study the growth stories of hundreds of companies. I’ve explored how these companies acquired their first users, found product-market fit, built growth engines, and nailed retention, conversion, virality, positioning, pricing, and most every other ingredient that goes into building a durable business. But I’ve never tied all of these pieces together.Starting today and for the next five weeks, I’m going to share a six-part playbook that I’ve been developing that guides you through the six fundamental steps of kickstarting and scaling your consumer business. Later this year, I’ll share a similar playbook for B2B businesses.This work is the result of hundreds of hours of research, interviews, and synthesis. It’ll include brand-new frameworks, stories, and insights that I’ve never before shared. It may be the best work I’ve ever done. If nothing else, it’s definitely been the most time-intensive.Here’s what’s in store:Step 1: INSIGHT: Come up with your idea ← This postStep 2: AUDIENCE: Identify your super-specific whoStep 3: HOOK: Craft your pitchStep 4: REACH: Find your early adopters by doing things that don’t scaleStep 5: RETAIN: Iterate until enough people stick aroundStep 6: SCALE: Build your growth engineFollowing these steps (or any steps!) won’t guarantee success—but it’ll certainly increase your odds.Let’s dive right into Step 1.Whether it’s disappearing photos, cars on demand, DVDs by mail, or a marketplace for NFTs, it all starts with an idea. And as much as you’re told that ideas don’t matter—don’t buy it.“I myself used to believe ideas didn’t matter that much, but I’m very sure that’s wrong now.”—Sam AltmanTo kick off this series, I dug into how 50 of today’s most successful consumer businesses originally came up with their startup idea. Below I’ll share:The five most common strategies for coming up with a startup ideaShould you sit around and think, or wait for an idea to strike?What signs point to it being a good idea?What to do once you have an ideaThis post also includes the largest collection of startup founding stories you’ll find anywhere.Before we get into strategies, a few takeaways (and surprises) from my research:High-level takeawaysThese consumer founders were very young. Half were under 30 years old when they started the company, and 80% were under 35.Less than a third of consumer startup ideas emerged out of founders trying to solve their own problem. I was expecting this to account for the majority of startup ideas.Less than a third of founders were actively ideating a startup idea when they came up with their big idea. In other words, most startup ideas emerged organically.Only 18% of winning consumer startup ideas came from pivots—I was also expecting this to be much higher.Less than a third of founders had a unique or specific skill that enabled them to build their product.Just over half of the biggest consumer business ideas felt very trivial at the time, e.g. Twitter, Snap, Pinterest, Coinbase, Tinder, Calm, Airbnb.Over 75% were founded by 2+ founders.68% had an engineering co-founder.42% had previously started a company.11% of founding teams had a co-founder with an MBA.Only one company, DoorDash, came up with its idea by actively talking to potential customers/users.You can see the analysis I did in this Google Sheet.How to come up with a startup ideaBased on my research of over 50 of the most successful consumer companies, there are only five common strategies for coming up with a great startup idea—all rooted in paying attention:Pay attention to your own problems, and solve them (~30%)Pay attention to your curiosity, and tinker (~20%)Pay attention to what’s already working, and double down (~18%)Pay attention to paradigm shifts, and work backward (~15%)Brainstorm with friends, and pay attention to the four points above (~15%)Here are these strategies mapped to today’s biggest consumer businesses:Below, I explore each strategy in depth and share the founding stories from each of these companies. Let’s get into it.Strategy 1: Pay attention to your own problems, and solve themThe largest chunk (~30%) of successful consumer companies emerged from the founders simply solving their own problems—and then realizing that their solution was valuable to others.For example:Dropbox: Drew Houston kept losing his thumb drive, so he built cloud-based file syncing.Etsy: Rob Kalin was looking for a way to sell his furniture and couldn’t find anything good.Cameo: Steven Galanis and Martin Blencowe needed to find business for their NFL client, so they experimented with pay-for-access to celebrities.Airbnb: Joe Gebbia and Brian Chesky needed to find a way to pay rent, decided to rent their air bed to travelers, and found that people enjoyed the experience.Apple: Steve Wozniak couldn’t find a computer he was happy with, so he built his own.Substack: Chris Best and Hamish McKenzie were worried about the direction content and journalism were heading in, so they decided to build a solution themselves.Uber: Garrett Camp was frustrated by his inability to get around San Francisco reliably and began experimenting with better solutions.Hipcamp: Alyssa Ravasio struggled to find great campsites, so she built a website to make that much easier.Snapchat: Reggie Brown wanted to send private photos without worry, so he recruited Evan Spiegel help him built an app that sent disappearing photos.GOAT: Daishin Sugano got ripped off with fake Air Jordans, which got him thinking about a better solution.WhatsApp: Jan Koum wanted a simple way to know what his friends were up to.Warby Parker: The founders kept losing their expensive glasses and realized there had to be a way to make them cheaper and easier to order online.Calm: Michael Acton Smith found that meditation helped him deal with his pain.As Paul Graham says, “Pay particular attention to things that chafe you.”Below are stories from these founders sharing how they overcame a problem they were facing, and how that helped them realize there was an opportunity to start a business.DropboxSource: Dropbox“I got really sick of having to carry my thumb drive everywhere, and if it wasn’t a bus ride I was getting on, I was about to put in the washing machine—it’s always one step away from disaster. And then I was on a ride from Boston to New York, forgot my thumb drive, and I couldn’t get any work done and started writing the first lines of code for what became Dropbox, even though I had no idea where that was gonna go at the time.”—Drew Houston, CEO and co-founder, via foundrEtsySource: YouTube“I started my own company with woodworking and I was making these couture computer cases, and I looked for the best way to sell those. I looked in the offline world, where there’s consignment and there’s wholesaling, and neither of those were really my cup of tea. I also looked at the online world and neither of those really worked out.And then the magical moment happened when I started working with Jean Railla, who was the creator of Get Crafty.... She asked me to help her rebuild Get Crafty. That was my introduction to designing websites.... I was looking to sell my own furniture, and so that idea percolated and I talked with Jean about adding a marketplace to Get Crafty. She said, and I probably agreed with her, that it would probably be better to start the marketplace separate instead of doing it inside of Get Crafty, because Get Crafty was really a community of people talking, so one thing led to another and the idea of creating the marketplace as a marketplace took birth.And when I initially started Etsy, my thinking was I’ll build the marketplace where I’d like to sell what I’m making, and then I’ll get right back to making these things.”—Rob Kalin, co-founder, via From ScratchCameo“The way the company started was Steven and Martin [co-founders] were chatting at a funeral, and Martin was talking about how we recently became an NFL agent managing Cassius Marsh and the challenges with trying to find him brand deals, etc.They decided to start a company where for X dollars you can do Y activity with Z athlete. For example, go golfing with Michael Jordan, invite Serena Williams to your daughter’s birthday, etc. The specific problem that Cameo was solving was Martin’s problem to get cash paid. At first.”—Devon Townsend, CTO and co-founder AirbnbSource: Sequoia“I get to San Francisco and Joe tells me the rent is $1,150. And I don’t have enough money to pay rent. It turns out that weekend, though, an international design conference was coming to San Francisco. And all the hotels in San Francisco were sold out. And so that’s when we had this idea. We said, ‘Well, what if we just turned our house into a bed and breakfast for the design conference?’ Unfortunately, I didn’t have any beds, but Joe had three air beds. So we pulled the air beds out of the closet. We inflated the air beds and we called it airbedandbreakfast.com.When we came up with this idea, I remember telling my mom, like, ‘I’m now an entrepreneur.’ And she said, ‘No, actually you’re unemployed.’ ”—Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder, via The Jordan Harbinger ShowAppleSource: TechCrunch“I didn’t want to pay to use somebody else’s computer, so I decided to design my own. I wanted to have it all in one place, and I already had a terminal, so I was partway there.”—Steve Wozniak, co-founder, via Byte magazineSubstack“The way it all started was through conversation between Chris and I. Chris was writing a draft of a blog post that he never ended up publishing. In the draft, he laid out all the problems with the attention economy, how it incentivized bad online content and behaviors that led to bad outcomes in society. He asked me for feedback on that draft, and I said all the things he was saying were true but that people in the media already knew those were the problems and what they were lacking were any meaningful solutions (not for want of trying). I suggested that he add a couple of paragraphs proposing a better way forward, but instead of doing that he started trying to convince me that we should make a thing based on direct payments between readers and writers because that would better align incentives between all parties. We were both readers of Stratechery and had heard Ben Thompson saying the model was working great for him and he didn’t know why more people weren’t trying it. We wondered what might happen if it were far easier for any writer to try to do what Ben was doing, since the effort required to set up and maintain all the infrastructure to run something like Stratechery was nontrivial. And that’s when we started brainstorming.”—Hamish McKenzie, co-founderUber“The city’s sad taxi situation seriously cramped [Garrett Camp’s] new lifestyle. Since he couldn’t reliably hail a cab on the street, he began putting the yellow cab dispatch numbers in his phone’s speed dial. Even that was frustrating. ‘I would call and they wouldn’t show up, and while I was waiting on the street, two or three other cabs would go by,’ he says. ‘Then I’d call them back and they wouldn’t even remember that I called before.’Habitually restless and frustrated by inefficiencies, he came up with his first attempt at a solution: he would call all the yellow taxi companies when he needed a cab. Then he would take the first one that arrived. Not surprisingly, the cab fleets didn’t like that tactic. Though impossible to confirm, Camp believes his mobile phone was blacklisted by the San Francisco taxi companies. ‘They wouldn’t take my calls,’ he says. ‘I was banned from the cab system.’Camp started to experiment with the city’s ‘gypsy cab fleet’—the unmarked black sedans that would approach prospective passengers on the street and flash their headlights to solicit a fare. Most San Franciscans, particularly women, would stay away from these unmarked cars, fearing for their safety or worried by the ambiguity of a cab without a running meter. But Camp found that a majority of the cars were clean and that many of the drivers were friendly. The biggest problem for these drivers was filling in the dead time between rides, when they tended to wait outside hotels. So Camp started collecting the phone numbers of town-car drivers. ‘At one point, I had 10 to 15 numbers in my phone of the best black-car drivers in San Francisco,’ he says.Then he started gaming the system further: texting a favourite driver hours before he needed him and telling him to meet him at a restaurant or bar at an appointed time. On another night, he rented a town car and driver for himself and a group of friends for an entire evening. It was an indulgence that cost $1,000, and zooming around the city at the end of the night dropping everyone off was a pain.And that is when the futuristic image from Casino Royale popped into Camp’s head. Suddenly, he was obsessed with a new notion. He frequently talked with McCloskey [his girlfriend] about the idea of an on-demand car service and vehicles that passengers could track via a map on their phones. At one point that year, Camp scrawled the word ‘Über’ into a Moleskine notebook that he kept to jot down new ideas and logos for companies and brands.Camp was certain that he wanted such a service. He also knew that the iPhone and its new app store, which Apple introduced over the summer of 2008, were going to finally make the futuristic vision in Casino Royale practical. Not only could you chart the location of an object on a map, but since the earliest models of the phone had an accelerometer, you could also tell if the car was moving or not. That meant that an iPhone could function like a taximeter and be used to charge passengers by the minute or the mile.The idea behind Uber was crystallising in Camp’s mind.”—The GuardianHipcampSource: Today“I was planning my first camping trip. I had been camping a ton before, but always with someone else doing the work, making the reservation. I couldn’t believe how difficult the process was. Everything was on so many different websites. So much was booked out. The information was super-fragmented.Finally I found a campground. We got down there and it was great. I walked out to the ocean and everyone was surfing. It turned out this place was a great surfing spot. I had read everything about the campground online, everything on their website, and nowhere had mentioned surfing. And I love to surf! I just sat there looking at this beautiful wave breaking and realized I had tried so hard and still missed what was the best part of this campground experience. I was driving back the next day when the idea came to me that getting outside was very broken, and that the internet could fix it.I learned how to program later that year. That June, I launched a very, very beta version of the website.”—Alyssa Ravasio, CEO and founderSnapchatSource: Insider“Reggie Brown [co-founder] carefully ran his fingers over the blunt, admiring its tightly rolled perfection. It was almost a shame to smoke such a work of art. […] The subject of the conversation moved on to the girls. A dreamy expression appeared on Reggie’s face. ‘I wish I could send disappearing photos,’ he mused, almost absentmindedly. […]Reggie focused on the usefulness of this new idea. A way to send disappearing pictures. He wouldn’t have to worry about sending a hookup a picture of his junk! And girls would be way more likely to send him racy photos if they disappeared.Suddenly, he jumped up, and rushed down the hall to see if Evan [Spiegel] was around. Bursting into Evan’s room, Reggie exclaimed, ‘Dude, I have an awesome idea!’ Even before Reggie finished explaining his idea, Evan lit up. He was immediately energized—almost intoxicated. It was just like all those nights of partying together, except they were drinking in Reggie’s idea. ‘That’s a million-dollar idea!’ Evan finally exclaimed.”—Billy Gallagher, How to Turn Down a Billion DollarsGOAT“When the [Air Jordan 5 Grapes] arrived [from eBay], I was so excited; I immediately opened the box and smelled them. There’s a very distinct Air Jordan 5 smell, and it just wasn’t there. When I put the shoes on, they didn’t feel right. After buying a lot of the same sneaker style, you know what to expect when they’re in hand/on your feet. The details of the shoes and the Jumpman logo looked off, the pods in the back looked deflated, and the laces were even a different texture.The purchase was my first pair of fake shoes, and it was a total letdown. And I wasn’t able to get my money back, because eBay has a poor policy for reconciliation that puts the burden on the buyer and seller to work out any issues. The experience really affected me, and for the first time I wasn’t excited to shop for kicks.My co-founder Eddy and I talked about the experience and he started grilling me with questions:‘Does this happen to a lot of people?’‘Who did the best job outside of eBay?’‘Is there anyone leveraging technology to solve this problem?’‘How do people search for sneakers?’It became apparent that the industry I loved was fragmented and unsafe. Many people buying sneakers were running into the same problems. There are entire subreddits, social accounts, and blogs built around how to spot fakes. People even post product SKUs in spreadsheets on forums like NikeTalk so others can find the shoes they are looking for. Essentially, everyone was piecemealing information together to find and purchase authentic sneakers.We knew we could use technology to solve many of the existing problems, and with the knowledge we already had in the space, we would have an additional edge. We also decided it was important for us to find an industry that serves a passionate and youthful generation. GOAT fit the bill, and we knew we were onto something. We just needed to start building.”—Daishin Sugano, co-founder, via Matrix PartnersWhatsApp“ ‘Jan was showing me his address book,’ recalls Fishman. ‘His thinking was it would be really cool to have statuses next to individual names of the people.’ The statuses would show if you were on a call, your battery was low, or you were at the gym. […]Koum spent days creating the backend code to synch his app with any phone number in the world, poring over a Wikipedia entry that listed international dialing prefixes—he would spend many infuriating months updating it for the hundreds of regional nuances.”—Alex Fishman via ForbesWarby Parker“[Right before starting business school], I had accidentally left my glasses on an airplane and they’d cost me $700. And I just couldn’t justify as a full-time student paying that much for a new pair of glasses. The new iPhone 3G had come out that we didn’t mind at the Apple Store paying $200 for, and it did all these magical things. And meanwhile, the technology behind a pair of glasses is 800 years old, and it just didn’t make sense. […]I was complaining to anyone that would listen about why glasses were so expensive. And then Andy kept losing his glasses, and he was buying everything online but couldn’t figure out why he couldn’t buy new glasses online and why no one was effectively selling glasses online. So we kind of started this conversation where we were kind of frustrated by different pieces of the eyewear industry. We knew that Neil [co-founder] had spent a number of years working for an eyewear nonprofit and probably knew a lot more about this than we did. And so we were all in the computer lab one day and started asking Neil a bunch of questions, and, no pun intended, but I think all our eyes were open that there was this massive opportunity. We thought, oh, why not sell glasses? And the light bulbs went off in all of our minds.”—Dave Gilboa and Neil Blumenthal, co-founders, via How I Built ThisCalm“I just couldn’t face going into the office every day…. I used to take painkillers every morning because I woke up with such a headache and my body ached, I felt like I was hit by a truck every morning. So these painkillers would kind of help me get started in the day. It was a very tricky time, so not addressing the fundamental issues with my business, or trying to but not doing a very good job—for me this is what led to Calm, because I could see it so clearly having been through it. One of the best businesses to ever set up is one where you’re scratching your own itch, and I didn’t know what meditation was or mindfulness, but my very dear friend Alex Chu had been meditating with CD-ROMs he bought when he was a teenager (a very unusual teenager), and he would often say to me, ‘Look, dude, you need to try meditation,’ and I’d be like ‘You need to try effing off. That’s the last thing I need. Give me something practical.’ But slowly but surely, the penny started to drop and I kind of got it, and the key breakthrough for me was when I did something I’d never done before. I took myself off on a solo holiday. I went away to the Austrian Alps, to this resort where I played tennis in the morning, I scribbled in my notebook, I read books, and I started to try to meditate because I’d heard about it, and it was just incredible. The fog started to clear; I’ve had my face pushed up against the cliff and I couldn’t see a way out of this problem that I was facing with my business, and just taking a step back and getting perspective was hugely valuable. And I read a bunch of books and research papers and I realized that you know, this is science: mindfulness is a way of rewiring the human brain. What if we could make this simple and relatable and accessible to everyone? This could be one of the biggest opportunities and businesses in the world.I came back, I remember chatting to Alex about it, and he was like ‘Right, dude, you finally get it. Let’s go.’ […]He found a person that owned calm.com […] and I said, ‘Oh my god, what a great domain, what a business we could build there, helping the world become more calm.’ I said, ‘How much is the domain?’ And he said, ‘It’s about a million pounds,” and I said … ‘Right.’About a year later, we’re playing video games and he said the guy that has calm.com wants to to sell it and he’s willing to to do a deal. We were able to buy it for much, much less… So we bought calm.com, and that was kind of the starting acorn that was planted for that business.”—Michael Acton Smith, co-founder, via The Diary of a CEOAdvice for finding startup ideas by solving your own problem:Build your self-awareness: Pay attention to challenges you have day to day.Be motivated: Pay attention to problems that drive you to action.Don’t take your ideas for granted: If you’re finding it valuable, it’s likely other people will too.Strategy 2: Pay attention to your curiosity, and tinkerTwenty percent of the biggest consumer businesses emerged out of the founders simply following their curiosity and intuition and then spending time tinkering with the idea. In most cases, soon after they had the idea, they quickly built a prototype to see if there was a there there.For example:Coinbase: Brian Armstrong got excited about the applications of crypto and decided to build a Bitcoin wallet.Google: Larry Page and Sergey Brin got interested in the web for its mathematical characteristics and built a crawler to rank pages.OpenSea: Devin Finzer got excited about what the new ERC721 standard made possible and shipped a beta of OpenSea in a couple of months.Musical.ly (aka TikTok): Alex Zhu noticed teens combining video and music and quickly built a prototype.Twitter: Jack Dorsey got excited about building a way to send simple status updates to friends and built a prototype in two weeks.Tinder: The early team built a prototype at a hackathon and couldn’t stop working on it.Duolingo: Luis Von Ahn started exploring language learning academically and got excited to see if he could build it into a business.Rent the Runway: Jenn Hyman’s sister told her she wanted to wear a dress once, mostly for the photographs, but still had to buy a new dress.The RealReal: Julie Wainwright’s friend bought upscale consignment while they were out shopping, and she recognized that it could be done much more effectively online.“A good way to trick yourself into noticing ideas is to work on projects that seem like they’d be cool. If you do that, you’ll naturally tend to build things that are missing. It wouldn’t seem as interesting to build something that already existed.”—Paul GrahamAs Steve Jobs said, the reason people have to have a lot of passion for what they’re doing is because “if you don’t, any rational person would give up. If you don’t love it, you’re going to fail. So you’ve got to love it, you’ve got to have passion.”Here are the stories from founders who found their way to a massive business through following their curiosity:CoinbaseSource: Twitter“I happened to see [the Bitcoin white paper] on Hacker News. I was just sort of reading things on the internet…. I don’t claim to have understood it the first time I read it, but I did have a degree in computer science and economics, and something about it grabbed my attention. I distinctly remember reading it and thinking, wow, this might be the most important thing I’ve read in like five years. […]And then at Airbnb, we were trying to operate in 190 countries around the world. There were delays; it was impossible to know how money was going to get moved in all these countries. And so I just had this sense that financial services are really holding back innovation in the world, and it’s holding back human progress because people don’t have the freedom to participate in this global economy, because of all the barriers to innovation. Imagine if you could unlock the level of innovation or the kind of trust in security that a society like the U.S. has, but put that into 190 countries, just because they have good internet access, a cell phone, and now they have crypto. And what if I could help do that? That just got me incredibly excited.”—Brian Armstrong, CEO and founder, via How I Built ThisGoogle“[Larry] Page didn’t start out looking for a better way to search the web. Despite the fact that Stanford alumni were getting rich founding internet companies, Page found the Web interesting primarily for its mathematical characteristics. Each computer was a node, and each link on a web page was a connection between nodes—a classic graph structure. […]It proved a productive course of study. Page noticed that while it was trivial to follow links from one page to another, it was nontrivial to discover links back. In other words, when you looked at a web page, you had no idea what pages were linking back to it. This bothered Page. He thought it would be very useful to know who was linking to whom. […] Unaware of exactly what he was getting into, Page began building out his crawler.”—John Battelle, WiredOpenSea“Initially, the idea for OpenSea stemmed from our interest in CryptoKitties. While marketplaces for digital goods have existed for quite some time, they tend to be self-contained ecosystems: individual marketplaces for specific games, marketplaces for domain names, marketplaces for tickets, etc. Scaling something like eBay for digital assets would be difficult because there was little standardization around digital ownership. With the introduction of ERC721, it felt like such an idea was possible for the first time.We validated the idea by joining the various communities for the new ERC721 project […] and shipped the first version of OpenSea within a couple of months, in order to get a product out there in the wild and start testing with early adopters.”—Devin Finzer, CEO and co-founder, via DeFi PrimeMusical.ly (aka TikTok)“I was on Caltrain one day, from San Francisco to Mountain View, and it was crowded by teens. Observing their behavior, 50 percent were listening to music and the other 50 percent were taking photos and videos with their speaker on top to add music. Teens are so passionate about social media, photos, videos, and music, that it made me think, ‘Can we combine these three very powerful elements into one app and build a social network for music videos?’ ”—Alex Zhu, CEO and co-founder, via ForbesTwitter“Jack Dorsey grew up in St. Louis, and at the age of 14 he became obsessed with dispatch routing. That was something he wanted to write software for, so he got to work on that. He was in St. Louis and there were no bike messengers there, but he was obsessed with this, so he wrote open source software for dispatching, which to this day is used by many different taxicab companies. He had this routing history, and he had this idea from when he first started seeing the status messages in instant messaging and wondered, ‘What if we could build a status service out of that?’So later, he came to us with this idea: ‘What if you could share your status with all your friends really easily, so they know what you’re doing? But you don’t want to have to write a whole blog entry or LiveJournal entry.’ At the time, we had been thinking about what interesting things we could do with SMS, because we were interested in it. And so we made the connection between status and SMS [in March 2006].So we went off and built a prototype in two weeks and showed it to everyone in Odeo. They really dug it. We knew when Jack told us the idea it was a cool idea, but we built it and showed it to the team and everyone started using it. I think the first weekend we were using it, I was ripping up all the carpet in my house, having a terrible weekend, and my phone buzzed and I look down and saw that Jack was sipping wine in Napa. The idea that I was doing what I was doing, and I could look down and see what he was doing just struck me. ‘I can’t believe I know that,’ and it made me giggle that I knew that.”—Biz Stone, co-founder, via MediaShiftTinder“About two weeks after Sean [co-founder] started work, he participated in a hackathon. Sean had been talking about potentially building out a dating product for a while, so the two [Sean and Joe Muñoz] were paired together based on the compatibility of their two passion projects. Over the course of the hackathon in February, they built the first prototype of Tinder.”—Jordan Crook, TechCrunchDuolingo“The whole thing started as an academic project at Carnegie Mellon between me and my PhD student Severin Hacker. I had just sold my second company to Google, and we both wanted to work on something related to education. Education is very general, so we decided to concentrate on one kind that is in huge demand everywhere (except the U.S.): language education.”—Luis Von Ahn, co-founder, via QuoraHeadspace“I was midway through a sports science degree when I left England and traveled to Asia to find some form of meaning, and I was eventually ordained as a Tibetan Buddhist monk after years of training. Ritually meditating four times a day, I became aware that many people outside this tradition didn’t know what meditation was, or had negative preconceptions about it....I returned to England—in a suit and tie, rather than robes—and found a doctor who was interested in mindfulness. I worked in his London clinic, where I was introduced to an advertising executive, Rich Pierson. We clicked from the start and began doing a skill swap—me teaching meditation and him giving lessons in marketing. Rich had amazing vision and saw the potential of what I was doing. He tried to persuade me to do an app—a very new thing at the time—which I thought was such a bad plan, so we launched Headspace as an events series in 2010. After receiving feedback that people had been inspired at our events but didn’t know what to do when they got home, Rich asked me to record some of the sessions. Almost three years later, those recordings became the main material of the app.”—Andy Puddicombe, co-founder, via Soho HouseRent the Runway“In the second year of business school, I went home for Thanksgiving, and I was in Becky’s apartment. And Becky had just gone to a store and bought a dress that was higher-cost than her rent. And as her responsible older sister, I remarked how she should probably wear one of the dresses in her closet again, as opposed to being in credit card debt. And her response to me was, you know: Everything in my closet is dead to me. I’ve been photographed, and the photographs are up on Facebook, and I need something new. And, you know, Becky was a 25-year-old, like, normal girl who lived in New York. She wasn’t a celebrity, but she was talking about being photographed and not being able to wear something.And it was like a light-bulb moment for me, because I realized I was having a conversation with my sister about the experience of wearing an amazing dress, of walking into a party, feeling self-confident and feeling beautiful. And that’s what she cared about. She didn’t care about the actual ownership of the items in her closet. The other thing she cared about was the photograph that would exist after the party that she could post on Facebook and kind of share with everyone.”—Jenn Hyman, CEO and co-founder, via How I Built ThisThe RealReal“The idea for The RealReal was born after I was out shopping with a girlfriend. My friend purchased items from a consignment rack in the back of an upscale boutique. I never knew her to shop consignment or buy from online resale websites. When I asked my friend why she said she trusted the shop owner—the shop was beautifully curated, and she was getting amazing deals on Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci. It changed my perception of consignment. The light bulb went off, and I did extensive research of the luxury and resale markets and even tested resale methods myself. […]In December of 2011 I had my aha moment, and by early March, I picked out a name, registered the business, and raised capital. In June 2011 I opened the doors.”—Julie Wainwright, CEO and co-founder, via Marin MagazineAdvice for finding startup ideas by following your curiosity:Give yourself time to tinker: If you’re excited, make space in your life to explore the idea.Build: Don’t just think. Build a prototype.Keep it simple: Test the idea as cheaply as you can, as quickly as you can. Your first idea is unlikely to be exactly right.Strategy 3: Pay attention to what’s already working, and double down (aka pivot)The third most common path to a successful consumer business, a path just over 15% of the companies I looked at followed, is to first launch something, pay close attention to which elements (unexpectedly) work best, and then double down (aka pivot) to that one element. For example:Instagram: Kevin Systrom noticed people weren’t using Burbn to check into places, but they were often sharing filtered photos they downloaded from other apps.YouTube: The founders noticed their video-based dating site was more useful as a generalized platform for all types of videos. Lyft: Logan Green and John Zimmer noticed their long-distance ridesharing service Zimride was struggling, but there was pent-up demand for shorter trips.Pinterest: Ben Silbermann noticed that his e-commerce app Tote wasn’t taking off but that people loved saving collections of their favorite items.Glossier: Emily Weiss noticed a budding need for personalized beauty products in her existing beauty community Into the Gloss.PayPal: In one year, the founding team pivoted from encryption on mobile phones to cash on mobile phones to cash on PalmPilots to cash over email, based on their learnings about what was possible and useful.Discord: Jason Citron found that his game business wasn’t working but that people loved its voice and text chat feature.Twitch: Every other product the team tried faded, while this one side project continued to grow.The best part about this strategy is that it should motivate you to launch whatever it is you’re currently most excited about—because even if the idea doesn’t work, it may lead you to the bigger idea.“The stars will never align, and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time. The universe doesn’t conspire against you, but it doesn’t go out of its way to line up the pins either. Conditions are never perfect. ‘Someday’ is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it’s important to you and you want to do it ‘eventually,’ just do it and correct course along the way.”—Tim Ferriss“If there were two paths where we had to choose one thing or the other, and one wasn’t obviously better than the other, then rather than spend a lot of time trying to figure out which one was slightly better, we would just pick one and do it. And sometimes we’d be wrong ... but oftentimes it’s better to just pick a path and do it rather than just vacillate endlessly on the choice.”—Elon Musk, speaking about PayPalHere are stories from companies that found their way to a massive business through pivoting, or simply doubling down on an idea that was already working:InstagramSource: Inc.“Most people don’t realize that we were doing a completely different startup before we did Instagram. We were doing something called Burbn. I remember we had maybe 100 users using the service. It was a check‑in app, a lot like Foursquare meets Gowalla meets everything else. […]We knew it wasn’t working when we would give it to people and they’d just keep bouncing off. The one thing that people would continue to do on the service was post square images from either Hipstamatic or CameraBag or whatever filter app existed out in the world, and people loved these posts.They got the most likes. They got the most comments. I would ignore every other post on Burbn except for the photos.One day, Mike, my co-founder, and I sat down, and we were like, ‘All right, we have to change something, because no one knows what we’re doing.’ We were like, ‘You know what? Let’s do what everyone’s doing on our service anyway. Let’s cut everything except for photos. Let’s build the filters in, and let’s allow for likes and comments and see what happens.’ I swear, the first day we launched it, we got 25,000 users.”—Kevin Systrom, CEO and co-founder, via Startups.comYouTube“When YouTube first launched in May 2005, it was still intended to be a dating service, rather than a generalized platform for all types of videos. So in the early, early days, it was trying to see if there was a need for a video platform for dating (rather than just photos/messages). I remember trying to recruit users to come to YouTube for that reason. We quickly realized that a dating platform wasn’t in demand of videos as the media type so we opened up the app to go after all types of content creators.”—Steve Chen, co-founderLyft“We were running Zimride, a long-distance ridesharing platform, and looking at the business, we realized that people took long trips pretty rarely. They also needed much more reliability than ‘I am heading to L.A. sometime this weekend,’ and coordinating pickup was a big challenge. John Zimmer [co-founder] mocked up something called ‘On My Way’ during one of our hack days, which was a service that would notify your passengers as you were approaching them to pick them up for your Zimride. We also started thinking about creating an ‘instant ridesharing’ product with firm commitments, even dabbling with calling it ‘Zimride Instant’—but we weren’t sure it would be legal.The Uber black-car experience was starting to take off, and then we saw Sidecar announce that they were going to launch that exact product we were thinking about. That was the kick in the rear we needed to hit the metaphorical gas. The founders grabbed a couple engineers and a designer, and three weeks—and a lot of hard work—later, that small team within Zimride launched Lyft.”—Evan Goldin and Adam Fishman, early Lyft employeesPinterestSource: San Francisco Chronicle“But while Tote users weren’t making purchases via the app, they were amassing growing collections of ‘favorite’ items to share with their friends. To Silbermann, who had collected insects as a kid, this was yet another example of people’s tendency to share their collections with one another. And while there was already a plethora of sites that allowed people to display virtual collections, they were all limited to a single item.So a year after launching Tote, Silbermann pivoted to offer people a visually appealing way to display all their collections—whether they were books, adorable dog images, or women’s clothes—on the same site. […] Six months after its launch, Pinterest, then still an invitation-only site, had 80,000 collections.”—Fast CompanyPayPal“Of course, neither team had set out to build the world’s foremost email payments system. For X.com, like Confinity, the feature emerged as an afterthought.In the fall of 1999, Musk and another X.com engineer discussed the concept of emailing money from one user to another, and they determined that an email address could function as a unique identifier, not unlike the digits of a checking account number. Nick Carroll, the engineer, recalled that the program took only a few days to build, ‘if even that.’ Musk concurred: ‘It’s trivial to do money transfer. It’s literally, you have a SQL database with one number, decrement that, and move it to another row in the database. It’s super dumb. My kid made one. He’s twelve.’Carroll and Musk alike found the feature’s success surprising. ‘It was totally an add-on,’ Carroll admitted. Amy Rowe Klement recalled that the X.com team thought of the person-to-person payment product as simply its ‘user acquisition engine ... it wasn't the core business. That was the online financial superstore.’ Indeed, Musk was frustrated that X.com’s other products didn’t generate the same excitement. ‘We would show people the hard part—the agglomeration of financialservices—and nobody was interested. Then we’d show people the email payments—which was the easy part, and everybody was interested,’ Musk explained in a2012 commencement speech at Caltech. ‘So I think it’s important to take feedback from your environment. You want to be as closed-loop as possible.’Despite frustration, the team responded to the product's strong market feedback and shifted focus to the incipient email product.”—Jimmy Soni, The Founders: The Story of PayPal and the Entrepreneurs Who Shaped Silicon ValleyGlossier“I started ‘Into the Gloss’ [a community she formed] because I wanted to create a space where people could celebrate beauty and share their routines. The women I was interviewing and the community that formed around the site had so much to say about their own experiences, and it struck me that brands were failing to leverage the power of their own customers. There had always been a ‘brand knows best’ approach—here’s an issue and a product to fix it. It really was an aha moment when I decided that, with our community, we could create a modern beauty experience that empowered people to be their own experts.”—Emily Weiss, CEO and founder, via Irish TatlerDiscordSource: Thailand Business News“His first company started as a video game studio and even launched a game on the iPhone App Store’s first day in 2008. That petered out and eventually pivoted into a social network for gamers called OpenFeint, which Citron described as ‘essentially like Xbox Live for iPhones.’ He sold that to the Japanese gaming giant Gree, then started another company, Hammer & Chisel, in 2012 ‘with the idea of building a new kind of gaming company, more around tablets and core multiplayer games.’ It built a game called Fates Forever, an online multiplayer game that feels a lot like League of Legends. It also built voice and text chat into the game, so players could talk to each other while they played.And then that extremely Silicon Valley thing happened: Citron and his team realized that the best thing about their game was the chat feature. This was circa 2014, when everyone was still using TeamSpeak or Skype and everyone still hated TeamSpeak or Skype. Citron and the Hammer & Chisel team knew they could do better and decided they wanted to try.It was a painful transition. Hammer & Chisel shut down its game development team, laid off a third of the company, shifted a lot of people to new roles, and spent about six months reorienting the company and its culture. It wasn’t obvious its new idea was going to work, either. ‘When we decided to go all in on Discord, we had maybe 10 users,’ Citron said. There was one group playing League of Legends, one WoW guild, and not much else. ‘We would show it to our friends, and they’d be like, ‘This is cool!’ and then they’d never use it.’After talking to users and seeing the data, the team realized its problem: Discord was better than Skype, certainly, but it still wasn’t very good. Calls would fail; quality would waver. Why would people drop a tool they hated for another tool they’d learn to hate? The Discord team ended up completely rebuilding its voice technology three times in the first few months of the app’s life. Around the same time, it also launched a feature that let users moderate, ban, and give roles and permissions to others in their server. That was when people who tested Discord started to immediately notice it was better. And tell their friends about it.”—David Pierce, ProtocolTwitch“It was as classmates at Yale University that the two [Emmett Shear and Justin Kan] first worked together, launching a web calendar startup called Kiko in 2005. It didn’t last. One month after launch, Kiko—designed to combine the power of Microsoft Outlook with the modern web sensibilities of Google’s then-new email product Gmail—was buried by a different solution: Google Calendar. After 14 months, Kiko did find an exit, however … it was sold on eBay, for $258,000.That money kept them going, and they learned from a series of further fizzle-outs, like a Facebook-for-families social network and a company that would sell glow-in-the-dark gene-spliced roses. Then the duo landed on one idea that Y Combinator founder Paul Graham was willing to invest $50,000 to see: a reality show devoted to broadcasting Kan’s life on the web, 24/7.Justin.tv began broadcasting in early 2007 and quickly scored some major headlines; Kan even wound up on NBC’s Today show and ABC’s Nightline. Shear said that part of what made the Truman Show-esque experiment work was that this time, the product was something its creators wanted for themselves.The site opened up to other broadcasters in October 2007. Three years later, Justin.tv had raised $7.2 million in venture capital and was claiming some 31 million unique users per month.It was at this time, in late 2010, that the company began working on two ‘skunkworks’ projects. One project, a Justin.tv mobile initiative led by Michael Seibel, would spin off into an Instagram-for-video startup called Socialcam, which sold to Autodesk for $60 million in 2012. The other, a task force led by Shear to grow the audience for video game content on the site, would also become its own product: a new site called TwitchTV.TwitchTV (later shortened to Twitch) has outpaced its predecessor. Meanwhile, Justin.tv’s star has faded.”—Eric Johnson, VoxAdvice for finding startup ideas by doubling down:Kill your darlings: You may love your idea, but if not enough other people do, it won’t work.Don’t take what’s working for granted: If any part of your product is proving to be valuable to people, that’s a rare find. Embrace it.Try stuff: The more ideas you put out there, the more likely you are to find something that sticks.Strategy 4: Pay attention to paradigm shifts, and work backwardAnother common strategy to coming up with an idea is to simply notice a shift in where the world is going, and work backward. As Mike Maples Jr. put it, “Start from the future and work backwards,” and as Paul Graham said, “Live in the future, then build what’s missing.”“From mobile to social to crypto, there’s so many examples where people failed to imagine what a couple years of compounding developments would look like, in terms of technology speed improving, costs dropping, or adoption increasing. We should be monitoring what’s compounding at a fast rate or, alternatively, where adoption is growing reasonably rapidly. The proof is in the growth rate or the extrapolated technology curve rather than the number sitting in front of you in that moment.”—Elad Gil, founder and investorExamples of founders doing just that:Spotify: Daniel Ek realized that the future of music was paid.Amazon: Jeff Bezos noticed that the web was growing 2,300% a year and found a product that would most benefit from being sold online: books.23andme: Anne Wojcicki realized that genetic information was suddenly cheap and available.Instacart: Max Mullen and Apoorva Mehta noticed the rise of on-demand ridesharing and delivery services.Stitch Fix: Katrina Lake noticed that retail was going to move online.Here are their stories:Spotify“I realized that you can never legislate away from piracy. The only way to solve the problem was to create a service that was better than piracy and at the same time compensates the music industry. That gave us Spotify.”—Daniel Ek, CEO and founder, via Fast CompanyAmazon“I was in New York City working for a quantitative hedge fund when I came across the startling statistic that web usage was growing at 2,300% a year. So I decided I would try and find a business plan that made sense in the context of that growth, and I picked books as the first best product.I made a list of like 20 different products that you might be able to sell, and books were great as the first product because books are incredibly unusual in one respect—that is that there are more items in the book category than there are items in any other category by far. Music is number two. There are about 200,000 active music CDs at any given time, but in the book space, they are more than 3 million different books worldwide, active, and printed at any given time.”—Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO, via YouTube23andme“I happened to be—when I was investing on Wall Street—I happened to realize genetic information, it was suddenly cheap to get access to a broad amount of information on your genome. And I was really lucky noticing that, one, suddenly, individuals could get access to your genome. And then there was this whole convergence of Web 2.0. There was going to be social networks. And you’re going to find each other. And it was hot. It was so interesting.And I suddenly realized that one of the things that’s a big issue in health care is there’s a lack of data. So routinely, my sister, who does nutrition research, said: you look at those studies, and it’s like 200 patients here, 200 there. And my dad, who is a particle physicist, would be like: anyone who knows about statistics knows you can’t find anything in this. You need lots of data. And clearly, the Google world had taught me the value of lots of data and what you can do with it.So I got lucky with this idea of, why do I need Stanford? Why do I need Pfizer to go and do all this research? I can just allow all these people to learn about their genome. It’s so cool. Learn about your genetics. And then we’re going to bring everyone together in this whole new research model. It’s going to be like crowdsourcing. We’re going to have the world’s data. I don’t need Stanford and Pfizer and all these other people. I don’t want you to be a human subject. I want it to be a live participant, excited in research. So we had this idea of really marrying this idea of cool technology with this concept of Web 2.0. And we launched the company.”—Anne Wojcicki, CEO and co-founder, via Talks at GoogleInstacart“I had several life experiences over the 10 years leading up to starting the company that eventually gave me the insight that this would become a huge consumer need. They included early adopting Web 1.0 delivery services, a business plan I wrote in college for a food marketplace, and then seeing the early days of ridesharing in 2011 after moving to San Francisco. Once I had that insight in April 2012, I was on a warpath to start this company, and I started telling my smartest friends about the idea and getting their feedback. By luck, one of them was Brandon, who introduced me to Apoorva in June 2012, and he had a similar consumer insight from working at Amazon. Then Apoorva and I brought Brandon on as our third co-founder in July 2012, and the rest is history.”—Max Mullen, co-founderStitch Fix“I moved on from Parthenon to become an associate at Leader Ventures, a VC firm, just as the iPhone appeared, in 2007. I was thinking about retail. I studied the economics of Blockbuster during the rise of Netflix. On one side was a company that dominated physical store sales; on the other was a company that dominated sales without stores. It was the perfect case study. And I could see exactly when the scale tipped. Whenever Netflix hit about 30% market share, the local Blockbuster closed. The remaining 70% of customers then faced a decision: try Netflix or travel farther to get movies. More of them tried Netflix, putting more pressure on Blockbuster. Another store would close, and more customers would face that try-or-travel decision, in a downward spiral.I recognized that other retailers might suffer Blockbuster’s fate if they didn’t rethink their strategy. For example, how would someone buy jeans 10 years down the road? I knew it wouldn’t be the traditional model: go to six stores, pull pairs of jeans off the racks, try them all on. And I didn’t think it would resemble today’s e-commerce model either: You have 15 tabs open on your browser while you check product measurements and look for what other shoppers are saying. Then you buy multiple pairs and return the ones that don’t fit.The part of me that loves data knew it could be used to create a better experience with apparel.”—Katrina Lake, founder, via Harvard Business ReviewAdvice for finding startup ideas by looking into the future:Spend time thinking: What is likely to be very different in 5, 10, 20 years?What hasn’t software eaten? Find a big market with a bad customer experience.What would be amazing if it were possible? Start with the ideal experience, and figure out what it would take to make it possible.Strategy 5: Brainstorm with friends, and pay attention to the four points aboveA final strategy is to simply sit around with your friends and think up ideas. Eight out of the 50 companies I looked at found their idea through active brainstorming. Michael Seibel has some great advice on this path (30-second clip):Here are a number of examples of this working:Thumbtack“The conventional wisdom when starting a company is to work on a problem that you’ve faced personally.At Thumbtack, we didn’t do that. Instead, for a year we brainstormed on weekly phone calls ideas of things we could start that, if successful, would create opportunity for people. We were focused on impact at scale. We knew we weren’t representative of the general population. We focused on issues that most people faced even if we didn’t personally.We threw so many ideas at the wall over the course of a year. The first one that stuck was an aggregator for all of one’s online financial accounts. We drafted our business plan ... then a couple weeks later, Mint.com launched and won TechCrunch 50. So we then moved to the second (and better!) idea that stuck—for Thumbtack. I don’t recall the specific moment the idea for Thumbtack came up. These ideas all came from observing the problems people faced in the world and thinking about how we could use technology to make things a bit better.”—Sander Daniels, co-founderNetflix“Silicon Valley loves a good origin story. The idea that changed everything, the middle-of-the-night lightbulb moment, the what if we could do this differently? conversation. Origin stories often hinge on epiphanies. The stories told to skeptical investors, wary board members, inquisitive reporters, and—eventually—the public usually highlight a specific moment: the moment it all became clear. […]There’s a popular story about Netflix that says the idea came to Reed after he’d rung up a $40 late fee on Apollo 13 at Blockbuster. He thought, What if there were no late fees? And BOOM! The idea for Netflix was born. That story is beautiful. It’s useful. It is, as we say in marketing, emotionally true. But as you’ll see in this book, it’s not the whole story. Yes, there was an overdue copy of Apollo 13 involved, but the idea for Netflix had nothing to do with late fees—in fact, at the beginning, we even charged them. More importantly, the idea for Netflix didn’t appear in a moment of divine inspiration—it didn’t come to us in a flash, perfect and useful and obviously right.The truth is that for every good idea, there are a thousand bad ones. And sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference.Customized sporting goods. Personalized surfboards. Dog food individually formulated for your dog. These were all ideas I pitched to Reed. Ideas I spent hours working on. Ideas I thought were better than the idea that eventually— after months of research, hundreds of hours of discussion, and marathon meetings in a family restaurant—became Netflix.I had no idea what would work and what wouldn’t. In 1997, all I knew was that I wanted to start my own company, and that I wanted it to involve selling things on the internet. That was it.”—Marc Randolph, CEO and co-founder, author of That Will Never WorkYelp“So I got to Max [Levchin]’s little office, little dumpy office, brick lined room, and it was just a bunch of different folks working on little internet ideas. What’s going to be the next big thing on the internet—which I actually was intrigued by.  And I thought, well, this is a fun exercise. I’ve always wanted to start a company—this is a good trial run for me to see if I could come up with a compelling idea that I could pitch Max on that he would actually get excited about. […]There was some interest within the incubator around the local space. It was, you know, we were observing. Craigslist was killing the newspaper business by carving out classifieds, and so that put a spotlight on the Yellow Pages, like, hey, here’s another old media business that hasn’t really been transformed by the internet. And so that got us thinking about what would be, you know, better than the Yellow Pages. And as I thought about and talked about it with my co-founder, Russ Simmons, who was another early PayPal person, you know, reviews, capturing word of mouth, bringing it online, marrying it with social networking—which was another technology that was just emerging; you had Friendster and MySpace. It seemed intriguing, but we didn’t think you could create a social network just around reviewing.It took us a couple of months, maybe a month and a half or so, to really zero in on an idea. Eventually I said to [Russ], you know, what if you asked me a question, like who’s a good doctor in San Francisco—I love to be the expert, I love to reply, to give you this helpful information. So out of this sort of back-and-forth conversation about questions, the idea emerged: maybe we can build a site around asking friends for recommendations.”—Jeremy Stoppelman, CEO and co-founder, via How I Built ThisReddit“Somewhere in the middle of Connecticut, on an exceptionally long train ride back to Virginia, my cell phone rang. It was Paul Graham. He wanted us back, but only if we changed our idea to something else. So much for proving them wrong. We got off at the very next stop, but not before I got Paul to buy us a pair of tickets to fly back to Charlottesville that night so we could return to Boston for an hour to join him in ‘brainstorming a better idea than mobile food ordering.’ […]We got back to the Y Combinator office and met with Paul Graham alone, without his partners. He told us to forget mobile for a moment and consider building something for the browser. […]He asked us about frustrations we had using the internet, which had just recently seen the launch of a college-only site called TheFacebook.com. Steve was an avid reader of Slashdot, a news website with editorial oversight and a robust community of commenters as well as a moderation system. I had too many tabs open every day—they showed me a range of news websites, but I had no way to filter signal from noise.At the time, a website called del.icio.us (pronounced ‘delicious’; ignore the dots) let people bookmark websites online, so if you hopped between computers, your reference material followed you. An interesting by-product of this was del.icio.us/popular, which aggregated the most popular bookmarked URLs at any given time. There was something here that del.icio.us wasn’t quite getting, but we saw the potential for something bigger, which would sort not the most popular links for bookmarking but the most popular links for sharing.We hadn’t figured out functionality, but we knew the old model for news aggregation, when it was printed on a dead tree, wasn’t suited for the internet age. In fact, the vision was best crystallized by Paul Graham in that very meeting: ‘That’s it! You should build the front page of the web.’ ”—Alexis Ohanian, CEO and co-founder, via RedditNextdoorSource: Social Capital Blog“We had no hierarchy at all. And we had this standing 10 a.m. meeting to come up with billion-dollar ideas. It was fun. We were kind of poking fun at it.And you would have ideas and they would come up and people would talk about them and then you’d find out, ‘Okay, who wants to go work on that?’ We had a lot of ideas that were focused on building and taking advantage of online community because that’s what we understood and what we knew. One of those ideas was what became Nextdoor, where one of our co-founders came in and said, ‘Hey, I’m trying to get a pothole fixed in my neighborhood and I realized there’s no way to communicate with the folks who live around me.’I remember the moment he said it. ‘Oh, that’s super interesting.’ And then we started to ... like, well, you have Facebook for friends and family, people you know. LinkedIn for your professional contacts. But people who live around you, how do you have a way to communicate with them?”—Sarah Leary, CEO and co-founder, via Mike Maples, Jr.DoorDashSource: The Stanford Daily“During our second year in b-school, we wanted to build something. We went door to door and asked business owners to tell us about their work. The most useful question, for me, was ‘Tell me everything you’ve done since getting here today.’Delivery first came up at a macaron shop. We were wrapping up an interview when we overheard the manager turn down a delivery order. If there was a light-bulb moment, this was it—why couldn’t businesses send things across town, on demand? There should be an on-demand FedEx!We tested just the consumer part first. We made a static HTML page at http://paloaltodelivery.com with a Google Voice number and a few PDF menus from local restaurants, offering delivery for $6. We launched a small AdWords campaign to see if anyone was searching for it.Hours later, Tony [Xu] and I were driving home when we got the first order. I grabbed a notebook and wrote down what the guy wanted from a local Thai restaurant. We placed a takeout order, drove to the restaurant, bought the food, took it to the customer, and charged him with Square.We quickly had trouble keeping up. I remember running out of class to answer the phone more than a few times. We probably took ‘Do things that don’t scale’ too far.”—Evan Moore, co-founder, via TwitterBumbleSource: TechCrunch“I received an email from Andrey Andreev—we’d met back in 2013, and he’d always said he wanted to speak to me when I had my next step after Tinder. We got speaking—he was really convincing—and said, ‘Hey! You should come be the CMO for my dating app.’ At the time I was allergic to dating apps and didn’t ever want to be in the space again. I told him, ‘Thank you so much; it’s really kind of you to have that belief in me. I’d love to work with you, but I want to start my own company and be CEO. I’m thinking of starting a social network, where the currency is compliments, just for girls and women…’I’d had a really tumultuous summer where I was being abused on the internet by strangers, and I really wanted to clean up the internet for young girls. I shared this vision with Andrey and he said, ‘That’s a great vision; I believe in it. I see these issues all the time on the internet, and there’s definitely something here. Why don’t we turn the concept into a dating app?’ I thought he was mad. I thought he’d lost his mind, but you know what? He was absolutely right—there was a huge opportunity to improve the dating space for women.We sat down, brainstormed what a dating app for women would look like—how it would work, how our past experiences could be drawn on—and it came down to one thing. Women were never in the driver’s seat with dating. It always came down to the man to take the lead, to ask the girl. There was this playbook where the guy has the power, the girl is weak and fragile waiting to be saved by Prince Charming—and this is disempowering for both sides.We decided to flip the script and empower people through connections, reducing rejections on the man’s side and empowering women to make the first move and be confident. That was the beginning of Bumble. And here we are, five years later, with almost 60 million users globally.”—Whitney Wolfe Herd, CEO and co-founder, via ThoughtEconomicsEventbrite“[Kevin Hartz] was already transitioning out of Xoom and he was starting to look at what he wanted to do next, what he wanted to build next. So he was primed to be in ideation phase. There were several ideas that he had actually prototyped and, to some extent, had built early versions of. One of the things was about this very simple transactional platform to sell tickets to any kind of event. […] And that became, that was the first idea that we had to work on together and, you know, just so happened to stick.”—Julia Hartz, CEO and co-founder, via How I Built ThisShould you sit around and think, or wait for an idea to strike?Of the more than 50 companies I looked at, fewer than 10 founders had sat around and actively brainstormed startup ideas. I’m sure many other founders were thinking about startup ideas passively, but most didn’t actively try to think of one. The majority of ideas emerged organically, out of the founders’ attempt to solve their own problem, following their innate curiosity, trying something and then doubling down on the part that was working, or having a sudden insight into a much better user experience.This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t spend time ideating—it just means that isn’t where most of the biggest consumer startup ideas have come from.What makes a good idea?Although there’s no way to truly know if your idea will work (otherwise, some VC would be batting a thousand) and many really good ideas fail, based on my research, the more of the following elements your idea has, the more likely it is to succeed:1. You can’t stop thinking about the ideaStartups only really fail when the founder gives up. The more passionate you are about your idea, the less likely you are to do that.Max Mullen, Instacart: “I was on a warpath to start this company.”Neil Blumenthal, Warby Parker: “You know one of those moments when you can’t sleep because you are just thinking? […] The four of us each had that feeling in our stomachs where we thought that we were really onto something and we really couldn’t sleep, and it was that next day that we all met back up at school and were committed to doing whatever it took to make it happen.”Brian Armstrong, Coinbase: “It was kind of an obsession. I don’t know what you’d call it. I kind of couldn’t help myself. I remember I was actually almost trying to talk myself out of it at a certain point because I was like: if you’d go down this rabbit hole, you know, you’re not going to be able to get out of it because this is not some kind of throwaway project you can do.”“We hear again and again from founders that they wish they had waited to start a startup until they came up with an idea they really loved.”—Sam Altman2. You immediately start building a prototype, and have the skills to do itMost of the companies I researched emerged out of a scrappy experiment that came together hours/days/weeks after the founders had the idea. That isn’t always the case, but it seems to be common for successful consumer companies. This is likely why over 80% of the startups had an engineering co-founder.Twitter: “We went off and built a prototype in two weeks.”Tinder: “Over the course of the hackathon, they built the first prototype.”Lyft: “The founders grabbed a couple engineers and a designer, and three weeks—and a lot of hard work—later, that small team launched Lyft.”Patreon: “The very day [I] had the meeting to talk about the idea, I went home to work on the code. I started working probably more passionately than ever on any other project. For me it felt like a race, and I had this fear that if we didn’t move fast on this, someone else would do it and I’d regret that.” 3. You have unique insight into the opportunityAlthough only about half of the startups I looked at were started by founders with specialized skills/experience, the majority of founders had a unique insight into the opportunity, based on some prior experience they had.For example, Alex Zhu worked on video and music apps before TikTok, Larry and Sergei wrote research papers and saw how citations were a sign of content value, and Brian Armstrong had a dual bachelor’s degree in economics and computer science. The unique insight is also why some of the best ideas initially sound crazy (e.g. Airbnb, Uber), trivial (e.g. Cameo, DoorDash), or impossible (e.g. Uber, Spotify, DoorDash)—you see the world differently from those around you.For that reason, also notice that among the stories I shared, rarely is user research a big factor in the early ideating. Most ideas emerged out of the founders’ experience, vision, and gut instincts.4. The idea is easy to understandEvery product we’ve looked at can be explained in a sentence or two. We’ll spend more time on this in Part 3 of this series. Broadly, if you can combine the right founder—who can’t stop thinking about that idea, has a unique insight into the opportunity and the right skills, with market  timing—you create the opportunity for massive consumer businesses.This is also why you shouldn’t be super-worried about someone stealing your idea—the chances that anyone else has this rare combination at the right time are incredibly low.What to do once you have an ideaAs Walt Disney said, “The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.” Here’s my advice on what to do as soon as you have an idea you’re excited about.1. Prototype it cheaply and quickly to validate the ideaStitch Fix: “Lake used Survey­Monkey to track customers’ preferences and then toted armloads of garments to their homes, accepting checks to cover the $20 styling fee.”Netflix: “We turned the car around mid-commute and drove back down to the town we lived and tried to buy a DVD. And of course there weren’t any—it was in test market—so we bought a used music CD and mailed that to Reed’s house in Santa Cruz for the price of a postage stamp. And the next morning, we learned is it a good idea or a bad idea.”DoorDash: “We tested just the consumer part first. We made a static HTML page at http://paloaltodelivery.com with a Google Voice number and a few PDF menus from local restaurants, offering delivery for $6. We launched a small AdWords campaign to see if anyone was searching for it. Hours later, Tony and I were driving home when we got the first order.”Rec Room: “They built the first game within 90 days and launched it quietly on SteamVR.”Hipcamp: “I learned how to program later that year. That June, I launched a very, very beta version of the website.”Don’t miss Todd Jackson’s in-depth post on validating your idea.2. Talk to potential customers to refine your ideaRent The Runway: “‘You know, we should really call Diane von Furstenberg,’ Jenny said. ‘Do you know Diane von Furstenberg?’ And I said, ‘Obviously I don’t know Diane von Furstenberg. But we could probably figure out her email address.’ Jenny and I wrote an email that afternoon to many different versions of Diane von Furstenberg’s email address. And we basically said, ‘Hey, we’re two women at Harvard Business School. We’d love to come in and talk to you about it.’ And this is where luck plays into the situation, because she or someone from her office opened that email. She responded, ‘I’ll see you tomorrow at 5 p.m.’ And we drove down to New York that next day, put on our DVF dresses, and walked into her office and introduced ourselves.”Rec Room: “To get early testers, they set up in the lobby of their WeWork and asked people walking by to check out the app.”Discord: “Citron and Stan immediately jumped into the server, hopped into voice chat, and started talking to anyone who showed up.”3.

Now, on to this week's post…Q: I’m building a marketplace and am wondering, what KPIs should I focus on and track?As you probably know, marketplaces hold a special place in my heart. I spent many years optimizing both sides of the Airbnb marketplace, and later spent hundreds of hours researching a series on kickstarting and scaling a marketplace. Based on this work, along with conversations with a dozen marketplace founders, and the insights many of you shared in this Twitter thread, below are my recommendations for the four most important metrics to track and optimize in any burgeoning marketplace:Fill rate: Percentage of intentful sessions that end up convertingBookings growth: Number of completed transactions per week/monthSupply growth: New active supply per week/monthGMV growth: Dollars going through your system per week/monthNote, these are in addition to the metrics every founder should be watching, no matter the business model, such as retention, user growth, payback period, etc. For completeness, I cover these and a host of other valuable marketplace metrics, at the bottom of the post.A big thank-you to Alex Taussig (Lightspeed), Ania Smith (TaskRabbit), Angela Tran (Version One), Dan Hockenmaier (Faire), Emma Guo (Offsyte), Grant LaFontaine (Whatnot), Kevin Tan (Snackpass), Matt Bendett (Peerspace), Mike Duboe (Greylock), and Mike Ghaffary (Canvas) for contributing to this post.Also, I have dedicated posts on metrics for consumer businesses and PLG SaaS businesses.Let’s get into it.1. Fill rate: Percentage of intentful sessions that end up convertingThis metric is the ultimate measure of marketplace health, because it’s the essence of what a marketplace is—a place people can consistently come to find what they want. It also bakes in important input metrics like supply quality, availability, and booking conversion, since in order for you to convert a purchaser, you need to have (1) the right supply, (2) that’s available and interested at the right time, and (3) a funnel that converts people.As an example, this would track the percentage of Airbnb guests who searched with dates and ended up booking a home, the percentage of DoorDash customers who searched for a cuisine and ended up ordering food, and the percentage of Uber ride requests that led to a ride. Sarah Tavel calls this “happy GMV”:Sarah Tavel @sarahtavelHappiness >> how many transactions you accumulate.\n\nThis is not to say that you shouldn’t grow. But if you think of growth as a means to increasing the average level of happiness per transaction (instead of the goal itself), it will focus you on quality growth over vanity growth. 9:10 PM ∙ Sep 7, 202018Likes1Retweeta16z calls this “match rate”:“It’s important to measure your successful ‘match rate’—the rate at which buyers can find sellers, and vice versa. How to define this metric depends on the unique business.”Many people call this metric “liquidity”—an ambiguous term I’ll cover at the end of this post. To Alex Taussig, one of the smartest people I know on marketplaces, this metric is primarily how he evaluates every new marketplace startup:\"The prime directive of a marketplace is to generate liquidity where none existed before. The founding insight for most great marketplace businesses is principally a ‘liquidity hack.’ Uber hacked liquidity by paying drivers to circle key neighborhoods even with no passengers. Airbnb hacked liquidity by paying for professional pictures of homes to give guests a better sense of quality. Faire hacked liquidity by guaranteeing items would sell and offering net 60 terms to retailers. thredUP hacked liquidity by processing merchandise on the seller’s behalf. The list goes on.So when I evaluate early-stage marketplace business, my analysis focuses on the liquidity hack and how effective it is for both new and repeating users. When it comes to metrics, I often examine the probability that an initiated transaction will be successful and watch it change in cohort time. Every company has a slightly different way of accounting for this liquidity metric, so the best analysis usually references your own benchmarks and watches how liquidity improves as new initiatives take effect. When I see that founders have unlocked novel liquidity and can consistently drive the metrics ahead of the initial benchmark, I get quite excited.”To operationalize this metric, you’ll need to identify what point along the user journey signals that the user is “intentful.” At Airbnb, this was a guest searching with specific dates. At Lyft/Uber, I suspect it’s somebody entering a destination, or even just opening up the app. At Etsy, it’s likely searching for a specific keyword. Benchmarking what is good here is difficult, because it can range from under 5% for an e-commerce marketplace to over 80% when you narrow in on bottom-of-the-funnel conversion. The most important thing here isn’t hitting a specific number, but a laser focus on optimizing it.“At TaskRabbit, we’re currently most focused on fill rate (or invoice rate, as we call it) as our north-star marketplace performance metric. This gives us a good view of the efficiency across our funnel ecosystem from the signal of the intent to successful completion. We also break it down across multiple decision points in the funnel to help us see opportunities for improvement and understand what is working well.”—Ania Smith, CEO of TaskRabbit2. Bookings: Number of completed transactions per week or monthIf fill rate is the ultimate measure of marketplace health, bookings is the best way to track marketplace growth. Unlike GMV (which is also incredibly important, as you’ll see below), bookings removes confounding variables like average order values, pricing changes, and outlier purchases. It directly tells you whether your marketplace usage is growing or shrinking.“You can tell a lot about the marketplace health by digging deep into bookings growth; for example, bookings growth by first-time users (user acquisition), repeat bookings growth (user retention), bookings growth within an organization (network effect).”—Emma Guo, CEO of OffsyteAt Airbnb, this was was our north-star metric, as it continues to be for the majority of marketplaces in one form or another:Uber and Lyft: RidesAirbnb: Nights bookedCameo: OrdersHipcamp: Nights outsideeBay: Items soldPeerspace: BookingsOffsyte: Events booked"},{"title":"The most important consumer metrics to track","article":"👋 Hey, Lenny here! Welcome to a 🔒 subscriber-only edition 🔒 of my weekly newsletter. Each week I tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out about work. Send me your questions and in return I’ll humbly offer actionable real-talk advice.Q: I’m building a consumer app and wondering what metrics I should focus on.There are many types of consumer businesses, and the metrics you focus on depend heavily on the type of consumer product you’re building. In particular, how you make money. Below I’ll focus on five types that I’m most familiar with:Subscription—trial-based (e.g. Calm, Noom)Subscription—freemium (e.g. Duolingo, Spotify)Ad-based (e.g. Snap, Twitter)Marketplaces (e.g. Airbnb, Etsy)DTC (e.g. Hims, Glossier)Don’t look at these suggestions as the one and only answer. Instead, use them as a starting point. As you learn more about what levers most impact the health and growth of your business (e.g. retention, margins, acquisition, etc.), focus on those. Try to narrow in on the two or three metrics that most directly drive your business’s success. I’ve learned this lesson many times over: greater focus leads to greater impact.Big thank-you to Sriram Krishnan and Yuriy Timen for contributing to this post.The most important consumer metrics to trackSubscription—trial-basedTrial-based subscription products generally succeed through low acquisition costs, a high conversion rate from trial to paid, and high retention. I’d start by focusing on the following six metrics:Trials growth: New trials startedConversion: % of trials that convert to customersCustomer retention: Month 1/3/6 cohort retentionRevenue: Monthly recurring revenueCAC: Cost of acquiring a trialGrowth spend efficiency: Payback period or CAC/LTVSubscription—freemiumFreemium-based subscription products generally succeed through building large pools of free users (generally through WOM/virality), a high-enough conversion rate from free to paid, and high retention. I’d start by focusing on the following eight metrics:User growth: New signupsUser retention: Week 1/2/12 cohort retentionCustomer growth: New paying customersCustomer retention: Month 1/3/6 cohort retentionConversion: % of free users that end up converting to customers after 1-3 monthsEngagement: Key action each day/week/monthRevenue: Monthly recurring revenueGrowth spend efficiency: Payback period or CAC/LTV"},{"title":"The most important consumer subscription metrics to track","article":"👋 Hello, I’m Lenny, and welcome to a 🔒 subscriber-only edition 🔒 of my weekly newsletter.

And even fewer people are going after it in a systematic way. For my own benefit if nothing else, last year I began collecting the best descriptions of PMF that I could find across Twitter, podcasts, books, and blog posts.Below, I’ve put together my favorite (and most actionable) definitions of product/market fit, broken up into pre-product and post-product, and sorted from the most concrete to least concrete. I’ve also added my favorite guides for finding PMF. If you’ve come across anything better, or have gone through this journey yourself and have a story to share, I’d love to hear it. Lenny's Newsletter is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.SubscribeWhat to look for Pre-Product1. Visible excitement“The real metric for both consumer apps and enterprise is — do someone’s pupils dilate when they use your stuff? Whether you’re handing them a demo or if you drew something on the whiteboard. Do they say, ‘You’re not leaving’ or ‘Where have you been all of my life?’”— Steve Blank (at 1:30m)“You have very strong customer feedback, even from a small group of people. For example, at Color early on, we were getting literal love letters from customers.”— Elad Gil2. People are willing to pay for it now“Are people willing to pay you for this product? Ask them this directly. Even try to get them to pay you now (i.e. literally send them an invoice) to get early access to the product. Nothing will be a better signal of interest and PMF if you can get people to put down money before you have a product. Try this even if it’s a consumer app that you won’t charge for — it’ll show you how much value you’re creating in people’s lives.”What to look for Post-Product1. Retention: Users stick around“Plot the % active users over time (for various cohorts) to create a retention curve. If it flattens off at some point, you have probably found product/market fit for some market or audience.— Brian Balfour“Do a cohort analysis. Look at a group of people that tried your product in a period of time (e.g. during one month). Then look at how many of those people continue to use your product later (e.g. 12 months later). You will have a fairly deep drop-off on the first month, that’s OK. What you want to know is, does it flatten somewhere? If it flattens, that means there is a group of customers that are finding value in your product, which means you have PMF, at least for those customers. The ability to acquire users at less than the amount of money you make from that curve represents your true product/market fit.— Casey Winters“Long term cohort retention is the best metric for determining if there is product market fit. Once you have a few cohorts that level off at a vertical-specific number, then you’ve achieved product market fit!Different types of products have different points of product market fit, so it’s important to find the retention rate of some comparable products that have been able to significantly grow to find the right benchmark for you.”— Jeff Chang2. Surveys: Users say they’d be very disappointed if your product went away“Survey your users and ask them ‘How would you feel if you could no longer use the product?’ and measure the percent who answer ‘very disappointed.’ If that percentage is over 40%, you have PMF.”— Sean Ellis / Rahul Vohra“For enterprise businesses, at the end of your free trial, you should pull the trial. If the customer doesn’t scream, you don’t have PMF. Because if they aren’t going to buy it at the end of the 30 days, they aren’t desperate. And if they aren’t desperate, you don’t have PMF.”— Doug Leone / Andy Rachleff3. Exponential organic growth“For consumer apps, you start to experience ‘exponential organic growth’, driven by word of mouth.”— Andy Rachleff (starting at 3:00)“The only way you know if you’ve built what customers want is because they are using it in an explosive and destructive way. If you are not getting explosive usage you are not building what customers want, or there aren’t that many customers which means you don’t have a big business.— Michael Seibel“I think the right initial metric is ‘do any users love our product so much they spontaneously tell other people to use it?’— Sam Altman“Organic growth is the key indicator of product/market fit. People love to seem smart and cool. They want to recommend something great to their friends. They don’t need a share button to do it. If they love your product, they will tell people about it. Ideally more than 50% of your new accounts come from direct or organic traffic.”— Merci Victoria Grace“If you’re a SaaS company and you have major brands finding and using you organically, and paying for your product, that’s a sign of PMF. Examples of that would be PagerDuty, which had Apple as an early customer. Zeplin, which had Facebook using them very early. Airtable has all sorts of brands that have adopted it.”— Elad Gil4. Cost-efficient growthBurn Multiple = Net Burn / Net New ARRThe higher the Burn Multiple, the more the startup is burning to achieve each unit of growth. The lower the Burn Multiple, the more efficient the growth is.This is a Measure of Product-Market Fit. The startup that generates $1M million in ARR by burning $2M is more impressive than one that does it by burning $5M. In the former case, it appears that the market is pulling product out of the startup, whereas in the latter case, the startup is pushing its product onto the market. VCs will make inferences about product-market fit accordingly.— David Sacks“For enterprise businesses, look at the contribution margin of a sales team, divided by the total cost to field the sales team… A sales team may cost on the order of $500k - $600k. When a company gets to a sales yield of greater than 1.0, that’s how you know you’ve hit PMF.”— Andy Rachleff (starting at 4:30)5. CAC < LTV“You have found product/market fit when you can repeatably acquire customers for a lower cost than what they are worth to you.”— Elizabeth Yin“Here’s my simple definition of product/market fit: The value of each user is greater than the cost of bringing them into the product. It means there are enough customers out there and you can efficiently bring them in”— Nikhyl Singhal“You have PMF when you see retention that creates enough $ or content/virality to drive sustainable acquisition.”— Casey Winters6. Customers clamor for your product“You can always feel product/market fit when it's happening. The customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it -- or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers. Money from customers is piling up in your company checking account. You're hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can. Reporters are calling because they've heard about your hot new thing and they want to talk to you about it. You start getting entrepreneur of the year awards from Harvard Business School. Investment bankers are staking out your house. You could eat free for a year at Buck's.”— Marc Andreessen“Are people grabbing the product out of your hands saying I want it, or I'm using it, or I'm buying it, or I’m downloading it, or I'm giving you my email address.”— Steve Blank“Founding a startup is deciding to take on the burden of Sisyphus: pushing a boulder up a hill. Pushing a boulder: don’t have product/market fit. Chasing a boulder: have product/market fit. Both are very demanding, but feel totally different. If you’re still pushing the boulder, you don’t have it yet.”— Emmett Shear7. People are using it even when it’s broken“If your product is broken and people are still using it, if you have high retention with a broken product, that’s a clear sign you have PMF. When Twitter was constantly going down in the fail whale days, and no one moved off of Twitter. That was a sign of raw market adoption.”— Elad Gil“A great measure of product/market fit, particularly in consumer, is when a company is growing quickly despite poor execution and management.”— Brett Berson“When the customers want your products so badly that you can screw everything up and still succeed.”— Don ValentineGuides for finding product/market fit:The Lean Startup Playbook for Achieving Product-Market Fit by Dan OlsenThe Never-Ending Road To Product Market Fit by Brian BalfourThe Only Thing That Matters by Marc AndreesenHow To Find Product Market Fit by David RusenkoHow Superhuman Built an Engine to Find Product/Market Fit by Rahul VohraThree bonus tips:Naval @navalMy number one predictor of whether or not a company will find product-market fit: High shipping cadence.5:07 PM ∙ May 14, 20193,816Likes735RetweetsJustin Kan @justinkan1/ If you don’t have product-market fit, your startup is fucked.

Each week I humbly tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out at the office.If you’re not a paid subscriber, here’s what you missed this month:Getting better at product strategyFostering a culture of experimentationWhen to hire your first product managerSubscribeQ: How do I know if my product is working? What does it feel like when you’ve found “product-market fit”?“When we hit PMF, we started feeling pull for the first time”“Like getting pressed into the back of your seat by a fast car or a plane taking off”“Word of mouth was uncontrollable”“Why won't you take my money???”“Yeah, you really can't miss it”This is what you hear from successful founders when you ask them what product-market fit felt like. But is this always what it feels like? I wanted to find out.Over the past few months I reached out to founders of the twenty five most iconic companies I could get a hold of and asked them one question: When did you first know you found product-market fit? Whatever that point means to you – was there something you noticed, felt, or experienced where you were like “Damn, I think we got something here!”After collecting and reviewing their stories (all of which you’ll find below), one thing became clear: every company did have a clear moment where they recognized they had PMF, and many did experience a sudden hard-to-miss pull from the market, BUT many companies did not see it immediately. For many companies, PMF became clear over time through a series of compounding wins or milestones. Here’s how it broke down across the companies I looked at:Some of my biggest takeaways from these stories:1. Market “pull” comes in many forms:An inflection in organic growthCustomers asking to pay for the product before you askUsers flip from being excited about what you have to mad about what you don’t haveCustomers complaining when your site goes downPeople using the product even when it’s broken2. About half of these companies found PMF immediately after launch, but half spent months or years iterating to get there:Netflix: 18 monthsSegment: 1.5 yearsAirbnb: 2 yearsPagerDuty: 2 yearsSuperhuman: 3 yearsAmplitude: 4 yearsOnce they got there though, it became obvious.3. The intensity of the pull is a factor of the fit (how good your product is at solving the user’s problem) AND initial market size (is it niche or broad). Dropbox, Netflix, and Tinder were 10x better products within a huge market —> sudden and broad pull. Instacart, Superhuman, and Substack were 10x better products but for a narrow set of initial customers —> steady and compounding pull.What is Product-Market fit anyway?I covered this in a previous post, and I want to make clear that getting to a feeling of PMF does not mean you’ll automatically be able to build a successful business. There are three things you have to get right to find True Product-Market Fit:Make a product that people want — that’s what this post is all about. Make a profit delivering this product to people at scale — companies like Cherry, Luxe, and Exec are valuable cautionary tales.Find and keep these people, sustainably — check out this previous post that covers the quantitative side of PMF, like retention and sales yield.Of these three milestones though, the most likely to kill your business is the first: not building something people want. And that what this post focuses on — how do you know when you’ve built something people want? Below you’ll find stories from twenty-five companies — many of which have never been shared before — revealing the moment they realized they had something special.Let’s dive in!❤️ A HUGE thank you to these generous humans who helped make this post possible: Alex Solomon, Brianne Kimmel, Calvin French-Owen, Chris Best, Cliff Obrecht, Dan Hockenmaier, Drew Houston, Henry Ward, James Beshara, Jason Wang, Jeff Morris Jr., Jeffrey Queisser, Joe Gebbia, Jonathan Badeen, Katie Dill, Keenan Rice, Li Jin, Marc Randolph, Matthias Wagner, Max Mullen, Nikhil Basu Trivedi, Nina Achadjian, Olivier Pomel, Patrick Lightbody, Rahul Vohra, Ryan Graves, Ryan Hoover, Samuel Yam, Sarah Leary, Scott Gorlick, Tai Rattigan, Todd Goldberg, Tom Preston-Werner, and Tomer London ❤️Sign 1: 🔥 Sudden and significant pull from the market“For me there was a visceral sense of your thing taking on a life of its own and lurching forward, like getting pressed into the back of your seat by a fast car or a plane taking off. The most standout moment for me was our demo video hitting the top of Digg (and then Reddit).”ー Drew Houston, CEO and co-founder“With apologies to Justice Potter Stewart, I’ve often felt that Product Market Fit is not unlike hard core pornography: hard to define, but you know it when you see it. It took us at Netflix 18 months to finally find the repeatable scalable business model that worked.As you know, I called my book \"That Will Never Work\" because everyone I pitched that original idea had that reaction. (Including my wife!). But they were right. The original idea didn’t work. But hundreds of failed experiments later, and after many a sleepless night of worrying, we finally tested the unlikely combination of No Due Dates, No Late Fees, and Subscription that ultimately was the thing that ended up working. And boy did it work. Within days of testing it we knew we had a winner. Where before we were struggling to get traffic, all of sudden we couldn’t keep up.  Our previously prodigious amounts of inventory were suddenly not enough.  Engagement soared, churn went dramatically down. Everything started working!If there was a moment when Netflix stopped being a start up and became a real company, it was then.”ー Marc Randolph, first CEO and co-founder“Uber never really had a product market fit problem — zero marketing budget and we were growing like a weed. Word of mouth was uncontrollable, and especially as regulatory heat started it's all anyone could talk about (is how it felt). Marketing was free because media loved the story.”— Ryan Graves, first CEO, founding team“Besides any gut feeling or friend input, I’d say we knew we had PMF towards the end of December 2012 when downloads started to pick up. By early to mid January 2013 those downloads started to skyrocket.The rise of Tinder was really fast and there were very, very few changes to the product before it had already taken off. The swipe had been added within weeks of launching in August or September 2012. I think we were working on the 2.0 of the app already before we rose but it wasn’t finished or released until we were already spreading like wildfire.”ー Jonathan Badeen, co-founder and CSO“The biggest difference between our ideas pre-PMF vs. when we found it was this feeling of pull. Before we had any sort of fit, it always felt like we had to push our ideas on other people. We had to nag people to use the product. When we hit PMF, we started feeling 'pull' for the first time. We solved one problem for people... so they started asking us to solve a second, third, fourth, and fifth. Most of our early product iteration was just responding to customer requests.”ー Calvin French-Owen, co-founder“For us it really felt like Geoffrey Moore's Inside the Tornado. Nearly 100% inbound sales because there was sufficient demand to keep the phones ringing.”ー Jeffrey Queisser, co-founder and SVP of Engineering“What indicated to us that there was something interesting here was that our friends who were using it asked if they could invite their friends, and those people invited their friends, and it spread through word of mouth process.We just put up a wait list on our site and demand took off, over a couple months we had a huge wait list. We weren’t expecting it.”— Patrick Collison, CEO and co-founder (source, source)“For Patreon, it was actually right after we launched with Jack's music video on YouTube video and patrons and creators started writing in.I'd never seen that level of passion and immediate resonance, and our launch was particularly fraught with stress since weeks before all the creators that were asked to launch rejected us. I actually emailed investors right after this, with a now cringey-esque note: ‘If you recall anything about me, I'm not one to exaggerate or overstate things, but based on the results and response thus far, I really think this company is going to be the one.’” — Samuel Yam, co-founder and CTO“About six months after we launched we changed our phone provider I think to DialPad or RingCentral. We misconfigured the system and for some reason after it prompted the user to \"Press #1 for Sales\" and the user pressed the button, it would just hang up on the caller. We didn't know about it for three weeks because we were just trying to fill the non-phone orders. The way we found out was a prospect was able to contact us through chat support and wrote \"I've been trying to get to your sales people for weeks and you keep hanging up on me!!! Why won't you take my money???\" That's what product market fit feels like.”ー Henry Ward, CEO and co-founder“When we launched our private beta (mostly enthusiasts from the Ruby community) we were offering it for free. To our surprise, users started writing to us asking ‘Can we pay for this??’ They liked it so much they wanted to pay for it. That was the first sign this was going to work.Our early users were individuals from the Ruby community. These people already demonstrated they were willing to operate on the cutting edge, Ruby was really new still in 2009. It was critical that we were embedded in that community before then, I don’t think we’d be able to convince people to try GitHub otherwise.After we got traction with individuals we were able to expand into SMBs, and then enterprises.”— Tom Preston-Werner, first CEO and co-founder“I remember distinctly it was a Friday night. We had been working on the wait list in preparation for our press launch, which would have been, I think, the following Wednesday or Thursday. Everyone goes home, and I wake up Saturday morning, and I open up Google Analytics, and I see something like 600 concurrents on our site, which nobody knew about at that point. I was just like, ‘What's going on? This is not normal. Something must be wrong. Right?’I'm just screenshotting the page; I'm calling my parents saying, \"Oh, this is crazy. It might actually be working.\" And up until that point, we never really had an idea of what success, at least in the consumer space, was like. That was sort of the first moment where we built something that actually worked.We ended up getting 10,000 sign-ups that first day, over 50,000 the first week, and almost 1 million in the first year.”ー Vlad Tenev, CEO and co-founder (source)Sign 2: 🎢 Steady and compounding pull from the market“Early on I had product-market fit anxiety. Do we have it? How will we know? There isn't really a moment I can point to where that changed. We've just been growing fairly consistently, and gradually the how-do-we-keep-up anxiety got bigger and bigger until there wasn't time left in the day to worry about whether we had product-market fit.We did have retention curves that looked pretty good from early on, especially for paying readers, and writers with paying readers.ー Chris Best, CEO and co-founder\"We found pockets of PMF with specific segments of founders, managers, executives and business development professionals. Once we recognized this, we were able to focus the entire company on serving that narrow segment better than anybody else. It’s a commonly held view that tailoring the product too narrowly to a smaller target market means that growth will hit a ceiling — but I don’t think that’s the case.The biggest specific moment of realizing we had PMF though actually occurred just when I had arrived at a conference. Before I'd left, I'd asked our Head of Growth to update all our analytics.  What we saw was that every single metric was amazing — growth, DAU/MAU, PMF score, NPS, virality, CAC payback, CAC:LTV, activation rates, long-term retention rates, and so on. That was when I realized that I could put together a series B deck that would raise an awesome round. And so I did!Just a month later Superhuman was on the front page of the New York Times, in the Economist, and in the Guardian.”ー Rahul Vohra, CEO and co-founder“For Instacart, product-market fit happened across a series of moments. we found product-market fit very early on with people who wanted groceries delivered as soon as possible and didn’t care which store they came from. This made us feel like we had achieved product-market fit but it was only with a small sub-segment of customers.The average customer wanted to shop from their favorite grocery store. So, we formed partnerships with top retailers. As a result, customers started to seek us out and word of mouth grew. We then signed more partnerships, reached a larger scale with customers, and in turn attracted more partners. Ultimately we created a marketplace where most customers can shop from their favorite stores, and as a result, customers have a great experience using Instacart and want to share it with their family and friends.Initial signs of product-market fit feel a bit like a calm breeze, while true product-market fit feels like a powerful wind at your back, accelerating you forward and compounding over time.”ー Max Mullen, co-founder“I distinctly remember one day when I thought we had reached product-market fit. We only had about ten neighborhoods using Nextdoor at the time. One of our engineers needed to upgrade the database which required taking the service offline for about an hour. As a lean team, he decided to start the migration (and make Nextdoor unavailable) around lunchtime in the middle of the week. We thought no one would notice the downtime since we had less than a few hundred users at the time.About ten minutes after taking the servers offline, I started getting emails and phone calls from concerned users. What happened to Nextdoor? One user called me in a panic because she needed to contact a neighbor immediately and the directory on Nextdoor was unavailable. Another user was worried that the service was suddenly gone and he was trying to organize a neighborhood meeting that night to save a local park. We rushed back from our lunch break to get the servers back online as soon as possible. It was an embarrassing mistake to take the service down mid-day without any advanced notice. But the good news was we had clearly built something that mattered in the lives of users – they noticed within minutes when the service was unavailable.If your users are urgently calling and demanding access to your product, you have clearly built something of real value. That’s product-market fit.”— Sarah Leary, co-founder“We  didn't have a sudden influx of new users, but from the moment we flipped from closed to open beta, we started seeing a regular influx of sign-ups, and as we added key features (such as alerting!), we saw them use our product more and more actively. This constant influx of new users has grown ever since then..”ー Olivier Pomel, CEO and co-founder“I can't recall a specific moment in time when it clicked and we said we had product-market fit. Instead, it was more of a transition where our confidence that we had reached PMF grew over time. We launched the beta version of PagerDuty in the summer of 2009 and the paid version in Dec 2009. That early version was very much an MVP oriented around alerting; it didn't even have the concept of incidents and incident tracking where you could track multiple incidents (issues) broken at the same time. We quickly realized that and added the concept of incident tracking in early 2010.Throughout 2010 and 2011, we saw exponential month over month growth... if I remember correctly >10% month over month growth in 2011. (Keep in mind, that growth was on a small base... I believe we hit $1m in ARR sometime in 2011). By the middle of 2011, we felt pretty confident we had product-market fit, as we were solving a real hair on fire problem with the platform (namely, ensure critical issues were handled quickly and no critical issue would fall through the cracks and impact customers and the business for an extended period of time) and seeing that consistent exponential month-over-month growth.”— Alex Solomon, CTO and co-founder“We had about 10 customers pre-launch (about 12 months of selling before launching), and we got them all through founder based selling & our networks. So I wouldn't say we had product-market fit yet. Although we knew something was there, we didn't yet know if this was a mainstream buyer or a niche. For a little background, these customers were not your typical analytics software buyer & they weren’t already buying any other analytics tools at the time (data warehouses or BI tools). They were engineers who were stuck doing data projects for the business. They were developers at the core and gravitated to Looker because it was a developer oriented/code-based way to do analytics in the backend, with a frontend that any business user could use. So over the 5ish months after launch two things happened that created our opportunity to be the next generation BI tool in the market — our fit happened because the market shifted:It turned out that there was a whole new generation of product/data people within companies who, once exposed to Looker, had the same revelations as our early engineering buyersAWS launched a new class of data warehousing in the cloud called Redshift. This was the first time data warehouses were easily accessible & consumable, and became AWS's fast growing service ever. From there it was clear that the data landscape was changing we had the perfect fit for it.”— Keenan Rice, early employee“As a founding team, we are pretty self-critical and tend to focus on how we can improve things for customers, or what's broken and how to fix it. So I think I only realized it 2-3 years after it happened. In retrospect though, a pretty good sign for PMF was when in spite of the obvious gaps in our marketing, product and care, we saw consistently high NPS (80+), low churn, and record high MoM organic growth.”— Tomer London, co-founderSign 3: 🥳 Hitting a meaningful milestone that proves the idea is working“Traction is one indication of product-market fit but there’s nothing like seeing your product being used in the wild. I distinctly remember walking into Philz one day overhearing a small group of friends talking about Product Hunt and their upcoming launch. I teared up. As founders, we spend so much effort building and hoping people love what we’ve created. Seeing a stranger use what we’ve built unprompted might seem trivial but it’s an impactful moment for myself and many others.”ー Ryan Hoover, CEO and co-founder“When my mom booked her first Airbnb, I said to myself, I think we got something here!” ー Joe Gebbia, co-founder“We knew we had product market fit when we had our first large company (Kabam) replace their lunch service with Caviar for the entire company. That was when we became sustainable and ramen profitable.”— Jason Wang, first CEO and co-founder“At Amplitude, Product Market Fit happened when we transitioned from focusing on Mobile Analytics to focusing on Product Analytics — building analytics for product teams.It was a pretty nerve wracking experience to shift our sales, marketing, and product strategy to focus on the needs of Product teams — I definitely questioned whether it was a justified risk given the traction we had already been seeing. That year we held our first conference called Amplify, the entire agenda was geared towards Product teams, and so many people showed up we had to open extra sections of the venue and have people standing at the back. >1,000 people from Product teams around the world showed up. While I was in line to get my pass I heard a whole team from a large bank talking together - someone said ‘I’ve been in Product for 10 years and this is the first time a company has ever focussed on us’. That’s when I knew we’d found PMF. ー Tai Rattigan, early employee“The moment we thought we might have product market fit was when we saw our designs being published on social media. At the time we had less than 200 templates so we knew what they all looked like. It was a real ahh-hah moment when we saw that Guy Kawasaki was using Canva to create more engaging social media posts.”— Cliff Obrecht, COO and co-founderHave any other stories of PMF to share?

Each week I tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out about work. Send me your questions and in return I’ll humbly offer actionable real-talk advice. Now, on to this week’s question…Q: I’m hearing from investors that I need a wedge, to narrow our product focus and our GTM. What exactly is a wedge, and how do I pick the right wedge?Whenever I think of wedges, I think of this guy:A wedge in business is the same idea—you drive a wedge into the market and then use that wedge to win the market:Twilio started with an API to send SMSs and is now the de facto communication API platform, worth over $60B. Airbnb started out allowing people to rent their extra rooms and now accounts for a fifth of the $90B vacation rental market. Amazon started out selling books and now represents about 40% of all U.S. e-commerce. If these companies had gone at their massive markets head-on, they’d arguably have had a much harder time. But by using a wedge strategy—focusing all their energy at one precise point—they were able to break in, build momentum, and win.“The wedge metaphor to me is most useful in making sure you’re not a blunt instrument trying to chop into a market by being everything for everyone, but instead the sharp blade with extraordinary focus on a specific persona/use case to start.”—Sarah Tavel, GP at BenchmarkWhat exactly is a wedge?A wedge is simply a strategy to win a large market by initially capturing (1) a tiny part of a larger market or (2) a large part of a small adjacent market.In business, as in rock cutting, a wedge is made up of two parts: (1) the right tool and (2) the right place to strike. In other words, the right initial product and the right initial market.Tesla’s wedge (into the larger transportation market) was a luxury car targeted at affluent early adopters. Robinhood’s wedge (into the consumer finance market) was a commission-free trading platform targeted at millennials. PayPal’s wedge (into the payments market) was an online payment platform for eBay sellers.Do I always need a wedge?I don’t think so. Companies like Zoom, Slack, Workday, Notion, Datadog, Spotify, and Peloton went straight at their respective (large) markets with an amazing product and won. You can argue about semantics, but in practical terms, as far as I can tell, these companies didn’t use a wedge strategy—they attacked a large market straight-on.“We kept hearing that to enter a big market, you need a wedge—something really sharp and really specific, and then you expand from there. It turns out for some classes of problems, such as infrastructure management, which is what we do, the wedge doesn’t work. There is a large amount of stuff you need to do from day one if you want your product to be useful. Our initial product was positioned as a very broad platform to bring multiple teams together, and actually didn’t have that wedge aspect. That disconcerted some investors.”—Olivier Pomel, CEO and co-founder of Datadog (source)When do I need a wedge?A wedge seems most essential when you’re going after a market that is (1) entrenched or (2) crowded. When it’s hard to break in head-on."},{"title":"How to validate your startup idea","article":"👋 Hey, Lenny here! Welcome to a ✨ monthly free edition ✨ of my weekly newsletter. Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out about work.If you’re not a subscriber, here’s what you missed this month:What is a good growth ratePreparing for a PM interviewOpen thread: How is your product org organized?SubscribeQ: I have an idea for a startup. How can I validate that it’s a good idea, and how will I know when an idea is promising enough to commit to?Committing to a startup idea is possibly the most consequential decision you’ll ever make. It’ll impact everything they do for the next 1 to 50 years, and either lead you to fame and fortune or a brick wall to endlessly bang your head against. No pressure.To help you navigate this critical time, Todd Jackson (partner at First Round Capital) spent 2+ months researching, interviewing, and synthesizing lessons from some of today’s most exciting companies to understand what gave them the confidence to commit to their idea. Below you’ll learn how these companies come up with their idea, validated it, and gained traction—along with a host of lessons learned along the way.In his nearly 20-year career, Todd has helped build some of the biggest products in tech that hundreds of millions of people use every day, from Gmail’s UX and Facebook’s Newsfeed, to Twitter’s timeline and Dropbox’s bottom-up revenue engine. He founded his own company, Cover, in 2013 and met First Round Capital when they led his seed round. Now at First Round he helps early founders launch and grow their businesses. You can find him on Twitter and LinkedIn.As a seed-stage investor at First Round Capital, I get to meet a lot of founders who are exploring and validating their ideas. It’s an exciting time for them and, as a former founder myself, I relate to the thrill and anxiety of just getting started. You believe you’re onto something and feel ready to bring your idea to life, but there’s also a lot of wondering, Am I crazy to pursue this?While there’s no single right way to get started or build a business—and timing, luck, and grit often play an outsize role—over the years, I’ve observed a few commonalities in how strong businesses got their start. From my own startup ideas (more on that here) and from talking to many successful founders, I’ve seen a few clear patterns around how people come up with their ideas, validate them, and build the conviction they need to go all in. There may not be a single playbook on how to build the next unicorn, but you can learn a lot from reverse-engineering how the best entrepreneurs went about building their companies.To give you some recent examples of the path from initial idea to success, I interviewed the founders of eight companies and spent many hours over the past two months digging into their incredible stories:Christina Cacioppo, CEO and co-founder of VantaRyan Petersen, CEO and founder of FlexportMahima Chawla, CEO and co-founder of CocoonJosh Wais and Lauren McDevitt, co-founders of Good DogKevin Tan, CEO and founder of SnackpassNick Fajt, CEO and co-founder of Rec RoomEdith Harbaugh, CEO and co-founder of LaunchDarklyKurtis Lin, CEO and co-founder of PinwheelTodd (and Todd’s chief of staff, Lindsay Goldman) interviewing Ryan Peterson for this postHere’s what I learned.How do I pick an idea and validate it?Based on my research, there are three common ways to come up with an idea:Market first: Start with a market or space that interests you, then look for a specific problem.Experience ripe for improvement: Look for areas where you believe there should be a better consumer experience than what currently exists, and iterate from there.Problem first: Start with a problem you’ve experienced firsthand and figure out if enough other people have the same problem. These methods tend to correlate with specific categories of companies:Let’s look at examples of how the founders I talked to used each method to come up with an idea, validate it, and gain confidence that they were on the right track. Start with a market/space first and look for a problem.If you already have a particular market in mind, talk to people in that space to more deeply understand their experience and challenges. There’s no set number of conversations to have, but I’ll offer suggestions near the end of this article. You want to look for a burning pain that’s so bad, customers will literally try anything to solve it.Christina Cacioppo is the CEO and co-founder of Vanta, an automated security monitoring platform that helps companies get SOC 2, HIPAA, or ISO 27001 certified quickly. Launched in 2017, Vanta has over 2,800 customers today and has raised $55M.Finding an ideaChristina started out on a couch with her co-founders, tossing around ideas for several months. Her advice? “Don’t do this.” She elaborates that when you’re at the idea stage, it’s easy to poke holes in everything if you ideate in a bubble: all the ideas are flawed, you’re limited by what you already know (which might be a lot, but it’s still a small subset of what the market knows), and it’s hard to get real feedback from anyone when you’re just talking through hypotheticals. Instead, she recommends getting out into the market, having conversations, and testing early models.After testing a few prototypes that didn’t work out, Christina decided to investigate the security space out of naive interest. “Securing the internet seemed important, particularly around the recent 2016 election and Equifax breach, and yet the tech industry seemed really bad at it. Why? And why are there so many cybersecurity companies and yet no startup uses any of them?” —Christina CacioppoShe started by interviewing founder friends and security leaders and asked them about the best and worst part of their days. She heard many answers, and tried and discarded several different ideas. But when she heard about security being a blocker to companies moving upmarket and unlocking revenue, that’s when she started to feel real interest from the people she spoke to. Digging in deeper, Christina and her co-founders discovered that SOC 2—often the first way a company needs to prove its security competency—was a major pain point and, while security consultants offered expensive help, many people wanted an easier solution.Validating the ideaThey started by developing a gap assessment similar to what a SOC 2 consultant would create, with the goal of confirming they understood the requirements of the SOC 2 process and that it could be broken down into simple steps. After hearing a strong desire for a “SOC 2 easy button” solution, they built a zero-code MVP (a spreadsheet) to test with potential customers and determine whether SOC 2 preparation was actually productizable. Both founders were skilled at product development but had learned the hard way not to write code until they’d validated that people wanted the product.Christina shared this MVP with friends, former coworkers, and people in their networks at companies ranging from two-person startups to multi-thousand-person enterprises to gauge their reactions. She knew they were onto something when she got a call from a friend out of the blue saying, “I heard you’re doing SOC 2. We should get a drink, and also can you do that for my company?” As more people proactively reached out to ask about what she was building, she got a real sense of market pull, which led to growing confidence.Christina didn’t try to segment her customers by total addressable market (TAM) but instead went where the pull felt the strongest. From her customer discovery conversations, she not only validated product-market fit but also found that selling to smaller startups would initially be easiest because those founders were most eager to get their SOC 2 report in hand. As the co-founders continued building, they found that small startups were seeking SOC 2 earlier and earlier—for example, fintech companies like Modern Treasury got their first SOC 2 report when the teams were just the founders.💡 Moment: When people whom Christina hadn’t even spoken to started reaching out directly to ask about using Vanta.Finding tractionThey joined Y Combinator, kept building the product, and completed their first full audit with a customer in November 2018. By the end of the year, with seed funding, a nascent team, and 30 customers, they suddenly realized, “Wow, this is working better than it should.”While raising their seed round, Christina was routinely asked, “How many startups, especially small ones, really need SOC 2?” At the time, they believed there were maybe 600 companies in the world that would need SOC 2. The co-founders knew that was too small of a TAM for a compelling venture-scale business, but they bet that as the technology evolved, software security would change and the need for SOC 2 would continue to grow. That prediction ended up coming true faster than they expected. Today, Vanta has thousands more customers than they even thought were in the company’s initial market.The Vanta team in May 2019 after a victorious trivia night (Vanta'ns are so good at trivia!)What advice would you give a founder just starting out?“Do all the product development best practices [market research, user interviews, validating mockups before building, starting with a lightweight MVP to test the core problem].Nobody wants to do them because they seem tedious, they’re less fulfilling than building, and when you’re excited, you just want to get started. But these steps make such a difference. It’s so easy to change a spreadsheet or mockup; it’s much harder to change code.”Quick tips:Build prototypes and test your early ideas on real customers; listen to their responses, and anything short of “I want this!” is really a “No thanks.”Don’t build a full product until you’re feeling real pull from the market. Figure out who you can sell to most easily, and start there. Market analysis can come later.Develop a product that unlocks revenue for your customers.Mahima Chawla is the CEO and co-founder of Cocoon, an employee-leave platform designed to empower companies to better support their team members through life’s most pivotal moments. Founded in 2020, Cocoon has raised $26M and seen rapid customer growth since its initial launch.Finding an ideaMahima and her co-founders, Amber Feng and Lauren Dai, started by exploring pivotal life moments, particularly around the significant transition to becoming first-time parents. They interviewed dozens of parents to surface the challenges faced during that major life change. Initially their interview script was open-ended around financial planning, but conversations consistently steered to the problematic topic of leave. They heard about big pains over and over. “In other areas, we were searching for the problem, whereas with leave it was obvious.” —Mahima ChawlaValidating the ideaThis prompted the team to start a deep exploration into the world of leave. They heard about the challenges of state and federal regulations. They heard crazy stories, including one where a coworker brought her laptop to the hospital for her C-section and was applying for California state EDD benefits while being wheeled into the OR so she would be paid during leave. After exhausting their own networks (which tended to be tech employees), they put an ad on Craigslist to talk to a broader audience that included hourly workers. The nightmare leave stories continued: not getting paid in full, not knowing they had the option to take federal- or state-entitled leave, drowning in paperwork, spending 10 hours on hold trying to track down state and private insurance benefits, and more.Once it was abundantly clear that leave was a pain point for employees, they did similar research on the employer side. Talking to dozens of companies confirmed that leave is an absolute nightmare, both for administration and employee experience. With conviction in the opportunity, Mahima, Lauren, and Amber limited their initial scope to addressing parental leave in California. They began by designing a UI flow in Figma, which they shared with the employees and employers they’d previously interviewed. The general reaction was that it was almost too good to be true: “I’ve never seen something like this before” and “I’ll believe it when I see it live!” They signed their first two customers—Carta and Benchling—off the Figma prototypes, which strengthened their confidence that they were on the right track.💡 Moment: Strong positive feedback from both employees and employers on product mockups of Cocoon—including selling their first customers based on Figma prototypes!Finding tractionThe Cocoon team raised a seed round in December 2020 and started building the product. While they’d validated that all types of employers in the U.S. and Canada, regardless of size and industry, needed a leave solution, they started by focusing on parental leave for companies in California, Utah, and Pennsylvania with 100 to 200 employees (the stage of growth when the challenges with leave administration start to surface). They expanded quickly to all 50 states and added medical leave.They used outreach to their networks early on to find companies interested in using Cocoon but soon had an influx of inbound leads from word of mouth and their website. That rush of interest gave them confidence that they were on the road to success (a pattern we’ve seen in both the Vanta and Cocoon examples!). The co-founders of Cocoon: Amber Feng, Mahima Chawla, and Lauren DaiWhat advice would you give a founder just starting out?“Go in with a very open mind. Don’t try to make something a problem, because if you do you’re going to find the evidence to support it. Really just truly listen to what the person you’re interviewing is actually saying and notice if there is a trend.”Quick tips: If it feels like you’re pulling teeth to find the pain point, you haven’t found a problem worth solving.If you’re building a marketplace or platform for multiple audiences, be sure to validate the pain points for each persona you’re targeting.Use an MVP or mockups to get early customer feedback before you build.Inbound demand is a strong signal you have product-market fit.Start with an intuition about a better consumer experience and work your way to a winning ideaOther founders, particularly those building consumer or marketplace companies, start with an intuition that there should just be a better consumer experience and set out to build it. This approach still takes a lot of conversations with consumers to pinpoint exactly where they’re experiencing pain, in and around the hunch that got you started. Start with your intuition, but don’t let it be the only information that informs your approach—unless you’re happy being your only customer.Josh Wais, CEO, and Lauren McDevitt, Chief Experience Officer, co-founded Good Dog to make it simple to get a dog responsibly. Started in 2018, Good Dog has now raised its Series B.Finding an ideaBack in 2010, Josh and Lauren started an online shopping platform called Wantworthy that didn’t work out, because it required consumers to adopt a new behavior. They wanted to try again, approaching the fresh start with a clear view of what it takes to create a successful company. They explored a number of ideas but were struggling to find a good one that leveraged their strengths and had a mission they felt passionate about. “For somebody entrepreneurial, you want to start a company, but you have to wait for the right thing to hit you personally and logically.” —Josh WaisThey found that idea in the concept for Good Dog. Both Josh and Lauren had experienced firsthand the challenges of finding a dog. As they talked to more people, they heard that others had faced these problems too—long waitlists, finding the right breed, finding a reputable breeder or shelter/rescue, avoiding potential scams, etc.—and saw the effects this had on both people and dogs. They saw an opportunity to create a marketplace bringing together reputable sources for getting a dog with consumers who wanted a trustworthy, confidence-inspiring, convenient experience. This mission felt more compelling than anything they’d worked on before, and they were excited about the prospects of creating a better system.Validating the ideaLauren’s background in product helped them employ design thinking to shape their validation process. She used “sacrificial concepts”—low-fidelity concepts that could be printed out and put in front of consumers to test different adaptations of potential solutions. They asked friends and colleagues if they knew of anyone who had recently  gotten a dog or was looking for one. Since people tend to talk about their dog search process, they were able to find a lot of subjects to interview. They also compensated participants for their time to reduce bias by making it less about the person doing them a favor.They then did a series of 20+ dog owner interviews, asking people to walk them through the whole process with questions like How did you decide you wanted to get a dog? What was the most painful part of the process? Which part was most exciting?After a month of interviews, they’d learned that people struggled or even gave up trying to get a dog because it was such a time-consuming and challenging process. Pain and hassle were consistent themes across almost every conversation. Finding so many pain points around trust and convenience in an area so personally important to people gave them certainty that they were onto something big on the demand side. To confirm their hypothesis, they experimented with finding dogs manually for hopeful owners and discovered there were a lot of people who were desperate for assistance. One of the sacrificial concepts the Good Dog co-founders showed consumers for feedbackThey then worked on validating the supply side of the marketplace because it was critical to have trusted, quality breeders on the platform for the community to work. This part turned out to be more challenging—they worked on it nights and weekends for six months, cold-calling hundreds of breeders and trying to get them to answer questions. Josh and Lauren didn’t know exactly what the value proposition would be for breeders, but they had so much conviction on the consumer side that they were determined to crack it. “We need to figure out the specifics, but we believe in the vision of where we’re going,” they said.Lauren McDevitt reviewing consumer feedback in the early days of Good DogFinding tractionIt took a full year to crack the supply side of the marketplace. Josh initially cold-called breeders using a script that felt painful and awkward to him. Then he had a revelation: if he explained the mission and that he was focused on recognizing responsible breeders and then dove right into the screening questions (i.e. starting with the hardest part), the breeders he called were much more inclined to engage. That approach tapped into the breeder’s pride and passion for their dogs, as well as the effort they put into their work and the welfare of their dogs. Good Dog went live with 300 breeders on the platform in March 2019 and started using Facebook ads, initially to build brand awareness with breeders and then shifting into informational content. Three months later, they had 600 breeders and a strong enough reputation to focus on adding a sign-up flow to the site. By the end of 2021, they had over 20K breeders live on Good Dog. Josh says, “The goal we set out, to become the go-to platform for responsible breeders, is now within our sights. Of the estimated several hundred thousand breeders in the U.S., over 50K have signed up to be on Good Dog and are either live or we’re screening and helping to onboard or bring up to our standards.” They’ve successfully built a community dedicated to advocating for responsible breeders and helped hundreds of thousands of people in their dog search.💡 Moment: On the consumer side, it was hearing about the deep pains people encountered, including giving up on their dog search altogether. On the breeder side, it was discovering that tapping into breeders’ pride in their work and passion for ethical treatment of dogs motivated them to engage with a new startup like Good Dog.The early Good Dog team coming togetherWhat advice would you give a founder just starting out?“Put in the work to try to gather as much information as you can to understand the underlying motivations/needs of users and the dynamics of the market you’d be entering up-front.

Founded in 2016, Snackpass has raised $96.5M to date.Finding an ideaWhen Kevin was in school at Yale, there was a big culture around going out for food after class or late at night, particularly at a really popular place called Gourmet Heaven (“G-Heav”). It was ridiculous pandemonium every Saturday night when people would struggle to even place their orders. Uber Eats had just recently launched, but students were still going to pick up their food and it was a crappy process, a bad customer experience, and a likely cause of lost revenue. Kevin envisioned a future where people could order ahead and skip the lines entirely.Validating the ideaWith this insight in mind and the desire to create something his roommates would love, Kevin tapped into relationships with a few local restaurant owners he’d built websites for in the past (including G-Heav) and went door-to-door to talk to the owners. He convinced them to join his new website to reach more customers, grow their brands, and offer discounts to verified students. He then built the website over Thanksgiving break, used an API to send orders to the restaurants by fax machine, and launched with five restaurants.In December around finals week, Kevin printed flyers and distributed them across campus to tell students about the website that would give them discounts and let them skip the line at participating restaurants.“It was amazing. It was the first time people signed up for a product I’d made. It was a trickle at first but kept growing and growing.” —Kevin TanThe Snackpass team showing off creative conceptsFinding tractionKevin saw signs of traction from the beginning, and within six months everybody on the Yale campus was using it (he estimates 90% of students!). The team created a mobile app for a better customer experience, added more restaurants, fixed a lot of bugs, and added the social layer that makes Snackpass stand out today. That social layer made it much easier for Snackpass to naturally spread, since the team didn’t have enough money (after being rejected from both YC and school funding) to offer cash incentives like referral bonuses for inviting friends to the app. They implemented a social points system, inspired by the Starbucks app, to reward users for orders and let them send points to friends on every purchase. Restaurants loved the idea because it drove word of mouth at no cost to them. Kevin and his team worked on the app over summer break, and when students came back in the fall, the response was overwhelming. Restaurants would call the Snackpass team to say they needed to shut down because they couldn’t keep up with incoming orders. Instead, the team went to the restaurants and pitched in, washing blenders and helping with deli orders to keep customers happy.At their second school, Brown University, the team had to overcome a lot of the same hurdles they’d experienced at Yale. Scaling the supply side was the primary bottleneck, so they built features to help restaurants onboard faster. The expansion to Brown was the first test of whether Snackpass was just a Yale phenomenon or had potential to be much bigger. By the end of the semester, Snackpass had taken off at Brown too.Kevin attributes their success to focusing on three core value propositions—saving time, saving money, and connecting with friends—and making all product and resource decisions with those in mind.💡 Moment: Seeing Snackpass take off at Yale through social mechanics and supply-side hustle, then repeating that same success at Brown University.Snackpass live at Sharetea in BerkeleyWhat advice would you give a founder just starting out?On finding an idea“It’s natural to think about things in trends, but there’s a great framework—the jobs-to-be-done framework—that says people hire products to get something done. That’s a more sane way to look at it than trying to map a trend.”On the art of advice: “Nobody ever gets penalized for giving bad advice.

Founded in 2016, Rec Room has raised $294M.Finding an ideaBack in 2016, Nick and the five other Rec Room co-founders were part of a group at Microsoft working on what would eventually become the HoloLens (a head-mounted display for AR tech). While building games and social apps for it, they realized the app model was fundamentally wrong. They were using the model of tiles that wrapped around your head, but the tiles didn’t work together. You could play with a pet in a pet app, chat with your friends in a social app, and visit Machu Picchu in a travel app—but you couldn’t go to Machu Picchu with your friends and let your pets run around. The team had the idea to figure out a different, richer app model where people could build rooms and objects and interact more across experiences. Nick wanted to make it possible for an object authored by one developer to work in space made by another, and he envisioned a social substrate that would stitch all these experiences together. He and the five others formed Rec Room to explore building a platform, developer tools, or their own engine but figured they’d be “wildly unsuccessful because there are six of us, no money, and a couple hoodies between us.” Instead they decided to start by building a game and slowly ladder up from an app that began as a toy but became a platform used by a host of creators from individuals to businesses.Validating the ideaThey built the first game within 90 days and launched it quietly on SteamVR, figuring nobody would notice. To get early testers, they set up in the lobby of their WeWork and asked people walking by to check out the app. They also posted on Reddit, asking people to try their new build and gave demos to investors from within the game. Nick describes the first app they built as “looking like Wii sports in VR with three really shitty, terrible rooms in it.” Yet people liked it.“We were very surprised. It struck a chord somehow and had a weird, buggy charm to it.” —Nick FajtThe Steam VR store at that time didn’t have any free content—existing apps had very expensive, limited content because the overall audience was so small—so the Rec Room team launched their app for free and immediately started picking up traffic. Says Nick, “I think what was pulling people back over and over was the social aspect. You’d land in a room and there were other people from all over the world wandering around. There was no menu—it would force you to be with other people and you could see and hear them. The human came through in a way that’s hard to describe.” People in the app could play games (paddleball, dodgeball, and disc golf), but the experience was very basic. Despite that, people were inventing other ways of interacting, such as putting on plays, hosting murder mysteries, or playing games like hide-and-seek that weren’t built in. This gave the team confidence that something was resonating—users were doing all sorts of things the team never imagined. Nick saw sparks of real love in the way people talked about the experience inside the app and in reviews. A gif from the very first version of the Rec Room app💡 Moment: Early users showed signs of true passion, despite bugs and limited functionality. People found ways to invent their own activities that the team never predicted, showing they were immersed in the product.  Finding tractionAfter that first launch, the team got on Oculus and started adding other games like paintball to create a more playful version of the typical gory first-person shooter games topping the VR store charts. They also added quests—cooperative adventures that people would go on together. People loved paintball and quests (and still do today), but the team started realizing there was diminishing ROI because the user response gradually waned with each new version but Rec Room’s costs continued to grow. The team then explored user-generated content (UGC) by looking into what players were inventing on their own by taking over rooms meant for specific games and exploiting system bugs to do their own activities, some of which were particularly unexpected and impressive.Growth continued steadily, but the team foresaw a plateau as the number of VR headsets available in the market topped out and the cost of creating new content grew. They leaned into UGC and launched on other screens (phones, game consoles, etc.) so people could play Rec Room outside of VR. Both caused intense audience backlash: VR players didn’t want non-VR players in the app, and everyone wanted Rec Room–generated content rather than potentially lower-quality UGC. In retrospect, while Nick recognizes that they should have evolved more slowly, he believes the changes were critical: “My view was that we’re not making enough money to operate this business, so we do this or we die.”It took a long time for the UGC and cross-platform shift to take hold, but once again, Nick saw sparks of love growing in the community as people got more creative with UGC. Launching on PlayStation VR, Xbox, and mobile eventually helped them jump from 30K to 150K users each month. Four years later, Rec Room now has 3 million monthly active VR users, which is just a fraction of its total monthly active usership.What advice would you give a founder just starting out?On the highs and lows of being a founder:“The absolute value of emotion you feel on any given day is way higher early in the founder journey. You can go from feeling on top of the world in the morning to feeling at the end of the day like the company is going to die next week. You’re going to be constantly surprised by the way people are using what you’ve built in ways that are inspiring, but you will also encounter problems that you as a 5- to 6-person company are horribly equipped to solve.” On how relationships can support you as a founder:“Optimize your relationships for the long term. That goes for your employees, your investors, your customers. You’re facing an existential wall, and it helps to have somebody who can just help you get through the next day or the next week. There’s all of these short-term decisions that feel like if you don’t take this sub-optimal path, you’re going to die, but it’s all about avoiding those traps.”One of the very first concept images the Rec Room team ever madeQuick tips: You can build toward a big idea by starting with a small step that’s more accessible and affordable to launch.Stand out from the status quo (e.g. whimsical paintball vs. gory shooters).Watch how customers use your product to find inspiration for new features.Listen to audience feedback, but balance it against doing what you believe is right for your company to survive and grow.Cover was my own company, an Android app that launched in 2013 and reached 2 million users before being acquired by Twitter in 2014. My co-founders and I didn’t stick with it long enough to see continued traction like other founders I spoke to, but I wanted to include it to show a close-up of what it means to get scrappy and learn from your target audience.Finding an ideaIn 2012, the iPhone was dominant, and our idea was to target an underserved market by focusing exclusively on Android. People with Android phones were used to feeling like second-class citizens—cool apps like Instagram and Vine were iOS-only, and the whole Android UX in the early era (Froyo/Gingerbread/Honeycomb versions) was pretty unpolished. It was also an unfamiliar market to VCs—I didn’t meet a single VC in 2012 who used Android as their primary device.Our thinking was that because of the developer capabilities available on Android, you could do cool things that were impossible to do on iOS, like modify the home and lock screens of the phone and access all the sensors. We envisioned creating a set of really cool experiences using those surface areas and had a ton of ideas around better app organization, surfacing better notifications and social updates, and generally just making the homescreen UI look cooler than the stock version. But we weren’t sure exactly which ideas would resonate most with users, so we turned to research.Validating the ideaTo better understand Android users, we posted an ad on Craigslist saying “Seeking Android users: $20 Starbucks card for 20min research interview (computer gigs).” When people responded to the ad, we sent them an email:My outreach email in 2013 to people who replied to our ad on CraigslistThen we camped out at several local Starbucks and interviewed each person who responded. We asked them why they chose their Android phone, what they liked and disliked about it, how they used it, and more. We then showed them various Play Store listings—some of which were real apps and others that I made in Photoshop (but we acted like they were real)—and asked for their feedback. Each interview was summarized into a simple dossier like this:One example of a dossier we created after interviewing Android users at StarbucksIt was awkward and time-consuming but absolutely worth it. We talked to 30+ users total, all of whom were complete strangers from outside our personal networks. As a result, we were able to design an experience that resonated with a broad swath of Android users—and critically, to appeal to both their functional and emotional needs. The secret insight? A lot of Android users at that time were insecure about their phones and wanted to feel cool and edgy for choosing Android. We’d never have learned that without taking the time to ask questions for hours at Starbucks.Finding tractionWithin a few months, we had raised money from First Round and were building the first version of Cover. We arrived at a v1 design that offered utility in automatically organizing your apps but also looked sleek and changed the theme of your lockscreen based on your location. In both our product design and marketing materials, we emphasized that everything Cover did was only possible on Android—this was in direct response to learning from users that they wanted to feel cool and unique for choosing Android, not like second-class citizens to iPhone.One of the best pieces of advice I got for driving a successful launch was from Gentry Underwood, the founder of Mailbox. Mailbox had grown incredibly quickly out of the gate because of its cool and innovative UX and excellent marketing. He told me that if you have a product that feels really interesting and different, strikes an emotional chord with users, and shows well in product demos, then the best way to launch that product is with a great demo video and an invite-only waitlist. It gets people really charged up: they naturally want to talk about the product, share the video, and eagerly anticipate their invitation. We followed that approach, made a slick video, and sent it to all the big Android blogs (Android Central, Phandroid, Android Police, etc.) the night before launch. When we woke up the next day, it was on all their homepages. The response from the Android community was immediate—Cover appeared on dozens of sites, hundreds of tweets, and even a handful of teardown videos in the first week—because it was a polished app that was only possible on Android, addressing that emotional need we had uncovered in research. We got more than 100K waitlist signups in the first week, giving us a ton of momentum.Cover got great press at launch because we targeted a passionate community around AndroidThe mechanics of the waitlist turned out to be quite useful because it provided a community of users we could iteratively test on via different cohorts. On the waitlist sign-up page, we gathered information like what kind of Android phone they had, which version of the OS they were running, and what country they were from. We let in ~1k users each week with a new beta release and were able to target certain types of users based on what we were trying to test (e.g. we could release to 1,000 Samsung Galaxy users running on S3 hardware with a specific version of the Android OS).This was huge in terms of helping us iterate and systematically refine the experience for different flavors of Android one by one. We spent about three months in invite-only beta, inviting wave after wave of users and steadily improving the product. We discovered our retention characteristics were generally binary—either users loved the app and kept it as their lockscreen (which they used hundreds of times per day) or they uninstalled it because it was doing something unacceptable like draining their battery. Determined to improve retention, we fixed compatibility issues, solved battery life problems, got location tracking working in different countries, and focused on making the app really solid. 💡 Moment: Tapping into a fervent community of Android enthusiasts and seeing them share the product, tweet about it, make their own teardown videos, and generally love and spread the app gave us a lot of confidence.We reached 2 million users before being acquired by Twitter about eight months after launch.I could go into a much longer story about why we decided to sell so quickly, but the primary reason was that we felt strongly aligned with Twitter’s mission and its desire to innovate more quickly on Android, but also because in the back of our minds we were worried about staying compatible with all the new versions of Android and continuing to innovate on what we suspected might become OS-level functionality at some point.What advice would you give a founder just starting out?“The biggest advice is simple—look for an audience that is large (or will become large) but is currently underserved, and then really take the time to dig in and understand their needs. Ask them questions, then another round of questions, and then another (sort of like the five whys). Don’t stop until you really understand the root causes behind their problems (again for us, it was the emotional factors around their relationship with Android). And then you can start testing solutions.”Quick tips: Seek out both functional and emotional needs from your users to make sure you build something that’s must-have, not nice-to-have (more on that here).You need to really dig for the deep needs—users often can’t verbalize them directly.Word of mouth can be your biggest driver. To encourage it, think about which communities might love your product and how a normal person in that community would describe it to a friend in their own words. Then use those same words yourself in the product, on your website, and in your marketing.Start with a problem you’re experiencing and figure out if other people or companies are experiencing it tooYou can also find a good idea by solving a problem you’re experiencing yourself. There’s a good chance that if you’re feeling the pain, others are as well. But don’t just assume this—you need to do the homework to make sure it’s a real and common problem. And it needs to be more than just a nuisance. No one pays for solutions to problems that aren’t impacting their lives or their revenue in meaningful ways. I’ve seen solutions to lived problems most often in developer tools, infrastructure, and other B2B companies. Founders who experienced a problem at one company sometimes leave to start their own business solving that problem for other companies. If you’re starting a developer or API-focused business where you’ve lived the problem before, it’s critical to have a deep belief in the usefulness of your tool but equally critical to make sure there’s enough market pull for what you’re building from other developers.Edith Harbaugh is the CEO and co-founder of LaunchDarkly, a feature management platform that allows software development teams to deliver to their customers. Started in 2014, LaunchDarkly was valued at $3 billion as of August 2021. The company currently has 3,000 customers, including 22 of the Fortune 100.Finding an ideaEdith had been an engineer at several startups and kept seeing the same problem over and over again with releases: developers would push a new release out to everybody and it would go horribly wrong. The company she was working for at the time had a basic system that didn’t get much attention or love. She knew that large companies had systems like this internally—Dropbox had Gandalf and Facebook had Gatekeeper—and that most companies wanted a system like those but didn’t want to have to build it from scratch.She had the idea to build a system where you could stage releases and push them to different people (the “dark launch”). After launch, you could also have different functionality for different users. She felt a deep conviction around how feature flagging could unlock an entirely new way to develop software. The co-founders of LaunchDarkly: John Kodumal and Edith HarbaughValidating the ideaEdith partnered with John Kodumal, a college friend who had been at Atlassian (which also had an internal solution to the problem). He started building a solution while Edith began talking to people to convince them to use it. Their first users were their old engineering buddies, including their first customer WidgetBox. Many of those users later admitted that the reason they tried the product initially was just as a favor to Edith!The first organic customers came in via SEO. In 2015, Edith started blogging around feature flagging and feature management as a way to create inbound leads. She had done marketing and product in the past and knew there wasn’t a lot of good content around feature management, so new content could rank well quickly. As an additional boost for SEO, she made a point to interview leaders at prominent companies like Facebook and Netflix to create content with titles like “Secrets of How Facebook Ships.” Finding tractionLaunchDarkly was an incredibly hard sell at first. Edith had thought it would be a self-serve business and that the value of feature flagging, staged rollouts, and the cloud were common knowledge. Instead, sales were much more hands-on than anticipated and required convincing people that this was how they should build software. She and John had to go to potential customers’ offices and sit with them to provide education. Because LaunchDarkly was a new product and small team, she knew it represented a risky sale. “If people had any alternative besides us, they’d probably do it. We had to convince people to trust us.” —Edith HarbaughIn the first eight months of selling, they got only one paying customer each month. “Those days were pretty depressing,” said Edith. “We tried to look for the bright spot that we had at least one customer a month, and got really excited when somebody signed up on the website, sight unseen without a phone call.” She found encouragement in a support call they did with InVision, an early customer: the call was on Zoom (much less common seven years ago than it is today), and suddenly more than a dozen employee faces popped up on screen. That showed her that people were invested in LaunchDarkly and using it enough to care about asking questions.They raised a seed round in 2015 but struggled to put together a Series A because VCs doubted that the market was big enough and that developers would pay for it. Instead, Edith got more customers and was on a path to become profitable. “Revenue is its own series A,” as she put it. In 2016, they signed their first six-figure contract, which felt amazing because VCs had previously told them it was a $5 per month developer tool. That six-figure customer paid by check, and Edith took a picture and sent a copy of the stub to those skeptical VCs. The growing sales had a snowball effect as current customers became references for new customers, and the business took off. While Edith was convinced her idea was sound from the beginning, she acknowledges it took a lot longer to get going than expected. “I remembered Jason Lemkin saying SaaS businesses would take two years,” she said. “But the customers that started using LaunchDarkly stuck with it—we had very low churn. I knew that it changed the way software was built for the better.”   When LaunchDarkly was a huge success years later, her former boss remarked, “Edith, you built the system you always wanted.”💡 Moment: Strong internal conviction from seeing this problem at previous companies carried Edith a long way, before eventually getting external validation from the inbound responses to the LaunchDarkly blog, the InVision call showing high employee interest, and landing their first six-figure deal.The LaunchDarkly team in the early daysWhat advice would you give a founder just starting out?“Build something you’re excited and passionate about but with a market that is more than just you. If you’re not excited about the work, it shows.”Quick tips: You can educate the market on the value of your product, but be prepared for a longer road.Your earliest users should feel the pain you’re solving very, very deeply.If you can’t raise funding, you can also grow revenue as a way to fund your business.Understand why your potential customers might say no, and work to help them overcome those objections.Deep conviction in the value of your solution can help you weather the harder times.Kurtis Lin is the CEO and co-founder of Pinwheel, the market-leading payroll data connectivity platform building the income layer to power a fairer financial system. Pinwheel has raised $77M to date, built a team of 100+, scaled its platform to 4.6M monthly transactions, and signed flagship customers like Square, Varo, Current, and many more.Finding an ideaKurt and his co-founders, Curtis Lee and Anish Basu, went through multiple early pivots in their founder journey and, along the way, built a framework for developing ideas, researching them, rating them on 32 different attributes, and stack-ranking them. The framework covered everything from TAM to potential regulations and natural acquirers—all elements he considered critical to building a winning business. Kurt had 20 ideas on the list before choosing the number-one idea, which eventually became Pinwheel.They started with health savings accounts (HSA), because Kurt and Curtis had both had poor experiences using them and recognized that many Americans living paycheck to paycheck lacked the cash flow to pre-fund their HSA. They considered building a way to invert the process and let consumers make health purchases on their Plaid-connected cards and then credit tax savings onto paychecks. They tested an algorithm to scan customer card transactions, flag them as medical expenses, and credit the tax savings back via employer payroll systems but ran into challenges around the volume of integrations needed because every potential customer immediately asked, “Do you support [Gusto, ADP, Workday, etc.] payroll system?” Pinwheel's poster board from a startup fair when the founders were still pursuing the HSA conceptInstead of building their product, they were spending all of their engineering hours building integrations into payroll systems, which led Kurt to wonder, If these integrations are this big of a problem for us, maybe they are also a big problem for other people. They built a lead list by identifying an ideal customer profile (ICP) and checking market maps and competitive analyses to find others who would ostensibly have the same needs, and then started talking to people. The moment Kurt and Curtis mentioned how difficult it was to access income and employment data, the tone of the conversation would change and people’s eyes would start lighting up. By the 12th or 13th conversation, it was clear the problem they were experiencing was quite common.Validating the ideaAt that point, they considered the TAM around who needs income/employment data to power their products and realized there was a real opportunity to focus on the infrastructure layer to help others build the products they wanted to build. Initially, they assumed their target customers would be digital lenders and banks. In doing user research, they heard that current solutions were too expensive, didn’t offer enough coverage, and had inaccurate or stale data. Pinwheel saw those as solvable problems if they could build API integrations and add a layer on top.Through additional research, they developed three hypotheses:They could provide better, cheaper, real-time data for lenders. They could meaningfully increase direct deposits for banks. They could extrapolate a combination of those two ideas and collect repayment out of direct deposits in a form of paycheck lending.While each idea seemed compelling, they felt like they needed to pick one as a wedge. They’d pitch all three ideas to prospective customers—Kurt got the whole pitch down to seven minutes and even tried switching the order in which he presented to see if the response changed, but people always leaned forward on the direct-deposit part. He would get interrupted by prospective customers: “Wait, you can do what?” Direct-deposit switching was the holy grail for many of their prospective customers, because it meant having a much deeper relationship with their users. That became the wedge.The next step was validating the implementation. They were initially worried that most people didn’t log in to payroll systems regularly and wouldn’t be able to remember their passwords (this was certainly true for themselves and their friends). But broader surveys showed that many people (especially hourly workers) log into their payroll systems much more often, with 70% to 80% logging in every day. This was another huge insight that confirmed the need for what they were building.💡 Moment: When Kurt mentioned the idea that eventually became Pinwheel to prospective customers, they’d give a noticeably strong reaction: perking up, nodding along, or even interrupting him—“Wait, you can do what?”Finding tractionPinwheel came out of stealth in June 2020 after fundraising, with no PR strategy other than asking a friend at TechCrunch to write an article. They’d hoped for 20 inbound leads from that one article and instead got 133 in the first 72 hours—not just other startups but major companies like Chase, Wells Fargo, Citibank, Bank of America, PayPal, Square, SoFi, Credit Karma, and more. The combination of prospective customer feedback around the direct deposit idea, validation from the survey results, and the strong inbound reaction led them to believe “There’s really something here.”The Pinwheel team bonding in the early daysWhat advice would you give a founder just starting out?On selling to businesses:“If you’re not decreasing cost or increasing revenue, nobody is going to buy your product.” On trying to reach PMF“What people never talk about is just how f*cking hard it is to actually get to product-market fit. In fact, most people never get there. Instead, all you hear about is all the breakout businesses where people magically found PMF. As Marc Andreessen said about finding PMF, ‘When you know, you know.’ Until you find it, you don’t have it. If you have to ask the question, you don’t have it. Put that as the bar you have to clear. It’s ruthless, but if you don’t look at it that way, you just won’t make it.”Quick tips: Create a structured way to assess your ideas and research to help you evaluate.Talk to as many customers as possible until you discover some earned secret or insight. Pick a single product wedge as a starting point.Ryan Petersen is the CEO of Flexport, a full-service global freight forwarder and logistics platform using modern software to fix the user experience in global trade. Founded in 2013, Flexport has raised $2.2B to date.Finding an ideaAn entrepreneur at heart, Ryan had his first inkling around the idea that eventually became Flexport nearly 20 years ago. He was running a business with his older brother importing products from China and really feeling the pains of managing customs, regulations, shipping, and other logistical challenges. He wasn’t alone: he saw that clearing customs was really challenging for people who aren’t experts, like entrepreneurs, Amazon merchants, and small businesses. In 2008, he started to lay out some initial thoughts for a business to address this pain in an Excel sheet. He envisioned building something like TurboTax for customs that would make it understandable and easy, with an expert available to walk people through it and get them cleared.“I wanted to be able to help a small business clear customs.” Validating the ideaBefore starting to build what he knew would be a complex platform, Ryan used Photoshop to create screenshots that looked like a real app. He put them up on a website to see if people would sign up for this fake product and used SEO and Google ads with a small budget to drive traffic to the page. Over 300 companies signed up for Ryan’s fake company, which gave him real validation that there were at least hundreds of companies who would want this if it existed. He conducted phone interviews with people who had signed up, as well as friends who ran importing businesses, asking questions like Who do you use for customs support today? What are you paying for these services? What are your pain points? What’s annoying to you? If you could have a magic wand to make a problem go away, what would it be? Throughout the interviews, Ryan would double-click on answers to dig deeper. He learned that people desperately wanted clarity and transparency into the customs process, their obligations throughout the process, when their cargo would be released from customs, what they would have to pay, and how to avoid customs inspections and holds.The sign-ups on the website, the findings from exploratory interviews, and learning that large enterprise companies didn’t have their supply chains dialed in beyond emailing Microsoft Excel and PDF attachments around gave him enough conviction to start building Flexport. 💡Moment: When Saudi Aramco signed up for the mock product on the website. “I thought I was going to get Amazon merchants and small companies, but then the biggest oil producer in the world signed up for my fake website. I realized this could be much bigger: I thought it was just going to be for small businesses, but if the biggest companies in the world are saying this is a pain point, there’s something here.” Finding tractionFrom 2010 to 2013, Ryan and his team worked on building v1, which included getting licensed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection, building the software, and meeting all of the compliance rules. While he had contractor engineers, his first employee had previously spent 25 years as a customs broker and was an expert on the process and rules. The product launched at the beginning of 2014 with a laser focus on solving the customs problem—companies had to actually buy freight from another provider. The sign-ups came in quickly—Ryan estimates several per hour. But many were individual, one-off customers, like the man who ordered a bouncy house from China for his kid’s birthday party or the U.C. Berkeley professor who bought a tuk-tuk in Cambodia and wanted to bring it home. There was a steady flow of demand from these types of customers, but Ryan felt it wouldn’t be enough to build a venture-scale business. When the team went to sell to companies with potential for repeat transactions and real supply chains to manage, those companies weren’t willing to sign up because they didn’t want to separate customs from freight.Ryan and the team quickly discovered that their hypothesis around focusing solely on customs was incomplete—companies wanted to buy customs and freight bundled together. They had always planned to add freight services but had assumed they could add that several years into the roadmap after perfecting the customs product. Instead it became apparent they needed to accelerate that to interest larger customers. That pivot to add freight made the business much harder to build but also more defensible and valuable. The team opted to focus on a broader product surface area, offering an end-to-end solution that was more appealing to customers. It stretched the team and challenged traditional product narratives around perfecting narrow areas of focus, but Ryan believes it ultimately made them better and made it much harder for new entrants to build competing businesses.Their first big freight customer was one of the world’s largest watchmakers: the company liked the promise of the Flexport platform but only wanted to sign up if it could get a specific price on freight. That price was half of what Flexport was paying for freight at that time, so the team had to hustle to set up enough business to lower their freight price to meet the watch company’s demand. It worked, and Flexport signed their biggest deal yet to ship 200 containers for the company.“It was very, very obvious at Flexport that we had product-market fit as soon as we moved into freight. We had trouble keeping up with the demand and had to learn as fast as we could how to do it, how to build systems for it, and how to be more efficient at it.” —Ryan PetersonIn 2014, Flexport joined Y Combinator, partnered with First Round, and earned $2M in revenue. They learned how to do enterprise sales to the biggest companies in the world while still maintaining a focus on serving SMBs and Amazon merchants. “There were no silver bullets here—instead there have been a lot of lead bullets and steady improvements to the way we work,” Ryan says. Once Flexport offered the full package of customs and freight, its revenue shot up quickly, growing by 4-5x per year (from $2M to $10M to $50M in just the first few years). Now, eight years later, the company is on track to do $5B in revenue this year and is the fourth-largest U.S. freight forwarder by volume operating on the world’s largest trade lane, the trans-Pacific eastbound.What advice would you give a founder just starting out?On deciding to be a founder:“If you’re doing it to learn, then you kind of can’t lose. If you’re doing it just to make money, on a risk-adjusted returns basis and accounting for the possibility of failure, founding a company is not the best way to make money, and you’ll ironically probably make less money.”On getting started: “A lot of people think that if they can’t raise venture capital, they shouldn’t do a startup. But I think you should pick something you can do, get started, and try to get traction before raising. I had student debt when I started one of my early businesses and I took side gigs to make money to pay that off while having the flexibility to work on my business.”On confidence: “Don’t be too sure of yourself. You have to be adaptable and open to the idea that you could be wrong and that there could be other ideas that are better than the one you have.”On finding product-market fit: “If you have to ask the question of whether you have PMF, then you don’t. It’s really obvious if you have it. If you can’t keep up with the customers and their demands, you have it. If you’re taking orders from internal management instead of external customers, you don’t have it. That’s fine, but don’t hire too many people, and keep your burn rate low.”On finding focus:“Spend your time figuring out which customers you’re going to listen to and prioritize, because you can’t help all of them.”Quick tips: Find low-lift ways like landing pages with mock product screenshots to validate your idea with real customers before starting to build.Assess your early customers to understand their needs, and use that information to make product decisions that align to your business goals.Consider taking on income-generating side projects in the earliest days of building your company so you have time to build but money to live.What traps should I look out for?No matter which method you use to validate a company idea, you’ll find no shortage of challenges. Here are six common traps:Trap #1: Asking the wrong questions. It seems really easy to just start talking to people, but if you don’t approach customer conversations correctly, there’s a good chance you’ll come away with useless or misleading information. Humans don’t see themselves clearly and are often bad at predicting their future behavior, so instead ask people about their past and current actions and problems. This will lead you to facts versus guesses and opinions. For example, instead of “Would you want to solve XYZ problem?” ask “How have you tried to solve XYZ problem in the past?” If the person tells you they’ve never looked for a solution to that problem, chances are good you won’t be selling them one. For more on this, check out the great book The Mom Test.Trap #2: Settling for a “meh” or “nice to have” reaction from early customer discovery. As an early-stage investor, this is the trap I see founders fall into most often. Remember that people are generally trying to be nice, so if you ask them if your new product would help them, they’ll probably say, “Sure, yeah, I’d check it out.” Successful founders didn’t settle for lukewarm reactions. They kept searching for a big problem and a solution that was literally being pulled out of their hands, even in the earliest, roughest version. Cocoon started by exploring ideas around financial planning and heard lukewarm reactions—but when they hit on parental leave, people pounced on the topic. You’re looking for that kind of energy.Trap #3: Not having enough conversations. It’s critical to talk to people in your market to hear about their experiences, needs, and frustrations firsthand. You should start having conversations from the moment you’re thinking of starting your business and not stop until you sell the company or close the doors permanently. Customers (potential, current, or past) are the best source of information on your company and product. There’s no one right answer for how many people you should talk to before starting to build your product because it really depends on what you’re building and who you’re targeting. In general, you want to keep starting new conversations until clear patterns and themes begin to emerge. For Good Dog, around 20 dog owners felt sufficient, since customers across different demographics mostly still find dogs the same way. But for B2B products, I prefer to see a higher number (like 50 or more), since different businesses have very different buying patterns. The founders of Cocoon talked to well over 50 people just during the early research phase! After you start building, keep conversations going to continually validate what you’re doing—feedback is your best tool.Trap #4: Selling a vitamin, not a painkiller. Painkillers are “need to haves”—if you have a headache, you’ll go out of your way to get an aspirin. Vitamins are “nice to have”—you’ll take them if you remember or have them handy, but they’re not a necessity. You want to build something people need right now and are willing to give you their time or money to get. Some classic “painkiller” products include UberX, Google search, and Mailchimp, while you might recall notable “vitamins” like Google Glass, Crystal Pepsi, and CNN+.  Trap #5: Myopia in focus (e.g. only focusing on the product). Having a great idea that people want is essential, but so is having a great way to get that idea out to the market. You need to be thinking about both along the way or your business won’t take off. You don’t need a go-to-market or growth strategy on day 1, but you need to have a few smart hypotheses for how you’ll find and win customers.Trap #6: Pivoting too early. It takes a long time and a lot of work to test an idea and give it time to develop. Don’t rush to throw in the towel and find a new idea too soon. There’s no right answer on timing, but expect to spend at least a month or two digging deeply enough into an idea to explore it fully and up to a year or more to bring it to life in the market. Trap #7: Pivoting too late. It’s also critical to not spend too long on an idea that isn’t going anywhere. Find an idea, figure out how to validate it, assess the results you’re seeing, and be ready to change course if you’re not feeling a strong pull. How do you know if it’s too early or too late? Unfortunately, there’s no magic formula. It’s too early if you truly believe you’ve found a real pain point and just can’t seem to nail the product execution or GTM. It’s too late if you’re out of money or sanity, or if no one seems to want what you’re building after multiple tries from various angles. Everything in between is a gray area. What do I do once I’ve gotten some validation that this idea can win?Celebrate ;) That seems trite, but I often hear founders say they wished they’d taken more time to enjoy the interim victories, however small, instead of always grinding on to the next step. This becomes especially important once you have a team that needs to feel like their hard work is producing progress worth acknowledging. Edith from LaunchDarkly shared how she leads her team: “Each day, we talk about what we did yesterday. Then we discuss what we’re going to do today. It keeps a one- or two-year project from feeling daunting. I also find that it creates a great deal of pride and accountability.”Beyond taking time to appreciate the small and large wins, there are steps the most successful founders take once they’re feeling real market pull for their solution and seeing traction:Document your metrics and share them with your investors and advisors so they know you’re making progress and are prepared to help you with next steps. Keep updating your roadmap and goals so your team knows where to focus their efforts and how to plan for and create continued growth. Carefully expand your team while making a conscious effort to build the company culture you want, all while keeping an eye on your burn rate and cash reserves.I’d love to give you tidy answers on when to raise various rounds of funding, but it’s not an exact science and there’s no one set of metrics to achieve for each raise. For general guidance, you should check out Lenny’s recent article on good growth rates based on conversations with 25 investors. As an investor now, I’m looking for a smart, motivated founding team taking on an interesting market with a solution they believe can win. How they demonstrate that from the idea phase up through raising later rounds depends on the company and how success is defined in that business. Final thoughtsFounding a company sounds glamorous and exciting, and if all goes well, it can be—eventually. But the road there is filled with a lot of steps that can feel awkward, tedious, or downright discouraging. I’m not going to lie and say I loved meeting strangers on Craigslist to ask them about their Android points. Every founder I talked to shared stories of doing hard things on the way to validating their ideas. Here’s a quick review of the steps they took:All of these tactics helped the founders better understand their audience and gave them the confidence they needed to keep building. I loved hearing these stories because it confirmed that all of these successful companies were started by people who were willing to put in the gritty work to develop and test their ideas over and over. I’ve noticed that after conducting all these interviews, when I hear new pitches myself recently, I’ve become especially mindful of learning the ways that founders discovered and validated a burning need for what they’re building. The early journey as a founder really comes down to a few steps, regardless of what kind of business you’re creating:Find an audience with a problem they want solved.Have the empathy and creativity to come up with a solution that resonates.Put in the work to validate the solution with your target customers.Make sure there’s a large enough audience who wants to buy what you’re selling.Find clever ways to reach that audience. Be willing to do things that don’t scale in the early days, but look for non-linear ways to scale as you go.There’s still a lot of timing and luck involved, but following those steps will create the conditions for success. First Round meets with dozens of early-stage founders each week, and we look for founders who will take the time to move through these steps. It’s not always a linear path, and every business is different, but the best founders take the time to search out a big problem worth solving and pair it with an earned insight on the right solution. If you’re that kind of founder, I’d absolutely love to meet you and hear what you’re building.You can email Todd at todd.jackson@firstround.com, and follow him on Twitter and LinkedIn.Have a fulfilling and productive week 🙏📣 Join Lenny’s Talent Collective 📣If you’re hiring, join Lenny’s Talent Collective to start getting bi-monthly drops of world-class hand-curated product and growth people who are open to new opportunities.If you’re looking for a new gig, join to get personalized opportunities from hand-selected companies.

Each week I tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out about work. Send me your questions and in return I’ll humbly offer actionable real-talk advice.Q: What exactly is the job of a product manager?I generally avoid meta questions like this, since they’re rarely actionable or useful. But because this is such a common PM interview question and because I’ve gotten this question from readers enough times and never found a definition that I like elsewhere, I’m going to tackle it this week.The job of a product managerI like this baseline definition:Your job as a PM is to deliver business impact by marshaling the resources of your team to identify and solve the most impactful customer problems.There are three parts to this, each essential:1. Deliver business impactFundamentally, you are responsible for delivering business impact. If your team drives positive impact—hitting important goals, reducing costs, shipping an important project, etc.—you’re doing your job.2. Marshaling the resources of your teamYour job isn’t to do the building yourself but instead to increase the leverage of your cross-functional teammates—designers, engineers, data scientists, researchers—to deliver impact. To paraphrase Andy Grove, a product manager’s output = the output of their team.3. Identify and solve the most impactful customer problemsBusiness impact comes from solving customer problems. Thus, it’s your job to lead your team to correctly identify, prioritize, and solve the most impactful customer problems.PMs are the ultimate business lever.Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.—ArchimedesThe three core jobs of a product managerAnother way to define the role of a PM is to break out the day-to-day jobs of a product manager:Shape the product: Harness insights from customers, stakeholders, and data to prioritize and build a product that will have the most impact on the business.Ship the product: Ship high-quality product on time and free of surprises.Synchronize the people: Align all stakeholders around one vision, strategy, goal, roadmap, and timeline to avoid wasted time and effort.All of that is a means to delivering impact.The attributes of successful product managersA different approach to understanding the PM job is to look at how PMs are evaluated. Earlier this year, I collected and analyzed dozens of career ladders from companies big and small, and out of this emerged 10 common attributes of successful product managers:"},{"title":"How to get into product management","article":"The role of product manager (PM) is the most fascinating role within tech teams right now. PMs are closest to the center of the action, have a disproportionate amount of influence over key decisions, and often go on to start their own companies. It’s no surprise then that product management has begun to show up on lists of the best, hottest, and most promising careers in the U.S. (and not just in tech).Seven years ago, after joining Airbnb, I decided to take the leap myself and transitioned from engineering into product (becoming one of the first few PMs at Airbnb). Since then, I’ve helped a number of folks inside and outside Airbnb transition into product from other functions, including from Operations, Data Science, and Finance. This post is a summary of everything I’ve learned and recommend when asked for advice on making this transition. I’ll cover how to make sure the PM role is right for you, advice on landing your first PM role, and the skills you’ll need in order to excel.Start with Why: Make sure PM is right for youThough I never planned to become a PM, I now couldn’t imagine having any other role within an org. It’s often a thankless, nerve-racking, and all-consuming. But, when it works, you feel like you were born to do it. Before you take the plunge yourself, take an honest assessment of what drives you — is this role actually right for you?Become a product manager if you are fulfilled by:Solving people’s problems (both your users’ and your team’s) 🙇‍♂️Driving business growth 📈Working closely with a variety of people 👨‍🎤Developing a strategy 🤔Getting shit done ✅Leading a team (through influence, not authority) 🤝Communicating often and broadly 🗣Making decisions 👍Creating amazing experiences for people 👌Being organized, detail oriented, and prepared 😎Do not become a product manager if you are primarily fulfilled by:Appreciation 🥳Having your way 😑Being left alone 🚨Always being right 🤓Designing or building things yourself 👩‍🎨Everyone liking you 🥴Flow states 🧘‍♂️Avoiding meetings 🤐Avoiding email ✉️Avoiding people 🤨You don’t need to connect with every item in this list, but if the gist feels right, keep reading.Plan the How: The four most common paths into PMBased on my experience, and the many experiences shared with me, here are how most people get their first shot at product management:Internal transition at a large company — Generally the easiest and quickest route, but requires three things aligning — an internal transfer process of some kind, having a chance to demonstrate the skills outlined below, and most importantly an internal PM champion for your transition (generally your new manager). If two of three exist, find a way to make the third happen. Otherwise, pursue one of the other paths. More advice on how to execute this move here and here.Finding a junior PM role at a large company — Likely the most common route, but is limited to companies with APM or internship programs. This is an increasingly common route for MBA graduates (though an MBA is not necessary to become a PM). If you don’t have an MBA, look into programs such as Product School and General Assembly, and join communities like PMHQ. Otherwise, look for ways to practice the below skills in your current job. The key to this route is clearly demonstrating that you are smart, driven, and have raw strengths in a handful of the skills described below. More advice on how to land this here, here, and here.Joining a startup with a burning need — The key to this route is having connections with startup founders, showing a lot of hustle, and delivering success when you are given the chance. Look for jobs at startups (HN/AngelList), find a way to meet founders, and focus on developing the skills I lay out below. Having a very strong growth mindset is key since you’ll have to learn how to do this job on the fly. In this path you can either start as a founding PM, or transition into it after doing the job for a while. The latter is how Airbnb’s original head of product got into product management.Starting your own company —This is by far the most work-intensive path, and rarely planned, but hey, it works. This is how I personally got into product management. CEOs often become PMs after an acquisition since the job is very similar. Alternatively, founders can take on the PM role at their own company as the company grows. I wouldn’t actually recommend prioritizing this route to becoming a PM, but it’s something to keep in mind when starting a company.Though this career transition often seems mysterious and random, it should give you comfort that every product manager working today has gone through this transition in one form or another. If you are still skeptical that you can make this happen, here are stories from PMs that came from engineering, design, data science, user research, program manager, consulting, sales, marketing, and business school.Develop the What: The seven core skills to buildThe role of product management varies by company and by team, but in my experience the following seven skills (in order of importance) are the most crucial to build early in your PM career. Along with a short overview of each skill, I’ve included a set of concrete suggestions for how to develop that skill, as well as links to my all-time favorite writing on each topic from industry experts. Don’t worry about being incredible at all of these — instead double down on your strengths and fill in the gaps.1. Taking any problem and being able to develop a strategy to resolve it 🤔The job of a product manager is to marshal the resources of their team to drive business value. Your team will be given problems (e.g. grow adoption of a product, reduce churn of a service, increase conversion of a flow), and your responsibility will be to guide your team to make it less of a problem. A strategy, paired with a clear vision, is essentially your route from problem to solution.A good strategy is a set of actions that is credible, coherent, and focused on overcoming the biggest hurdle(s) in achieving a particular objective.— Richard RumeltSome recommendations for developing your strategic thinking:Ask the best PMs you know to talk you through the vision and strategy they developed for a recent product initiative (they’ll be excited to share, trust me)Take a problem your current company (or friend) is having and come up with a framework that breaks the problem into solvable chunksLearn about the difference between vision, mission and strategyRead WTF is Strategy? by Vince LawRead How to Become a Strategic Leader by Julie ZhuoRead Applying Leverage as a Product Manager by Brandon ChuRead A Three-Step Framework For Solving Problems by me 🙃Read about and practice Amazon’s working backwards strategyBuy and read Good Strategy, Bad Strategy by Richard Rumelt2. Executing, getting shit done ✅A PM that is good at nothing else but execution is valuable to a team, while a team with a PM that can’t execute is better off without that PM. Tactically this includes things like building a roadmap that everyone on your team is aligned behind, setting and hitting deadlines, and ruthlessly unblocking blockers. For new PMs, my advice is to begin practicing this skill immediately.Executing well is like captaining a tight, smooth-sailing ship. You need to make sure that everyone knows what they need to do and then does it, that the crew hums together in unison, [and] that you estimated the journey well enough to have packed ample supplies.— Julie ZhuoSome recommendations for developing your execution skills:You’ll only learn how to execute by doing. Find a friendly PM and ask to take on the “project management” duties for one of their projects (pro tip: don’t ever call a product manager a project manager 😳).Pay attention to people around you that are good at shipping — how do they run meetings, how do they address issues as they arise, what systems do they use to keep their team aligned?Learn about OKRs and goal setting by reading Measure What Matters by John DoerrAs Sachin Rekhi suggests, regularly ask yourself “how am I going to move my product forward today?”Read Building Products by Julie ZhuoRead A Product Manager’s Job by Josh ElmanRead about Sheryl Sandberg’s Career Advice3. Communication 🗣Engineers code, designers produce designs, and product managers …communicate. Everything you do as a product manager is done through writing, speaking, and meetings. As Boz puts it, “communication is the job.” You can never be too good at this, and it’s very difficult to over-communicate.The burden of communicating among teams, in between departments, and being the go-to get-it-done-guy/gal for CEOs and managers — it all tends to fall heavily on the Product Manager’s shoulders. Product Managers are the linchpins of their organizations. The fillers of “the white space” — the processes and tasks that need to happen, but for which no one is specifically responsible.— Nichole Elizabeth DeMeréSome recommendations for developing your communication skill (borrowed from my previous post):Emails: Force yourself to look at your email at least once before sending it. There’s always something you can cut or clarify. Here’s an email strategy I love, courtesy of the military. Also, know that it’s very difficult to over-communicate.Docs: Always ask for feedback from at least one person before sharing a doc widely. Focus on clean and consistent formatting. Close out comments before sharing with execs. Make it easy to scan. Keep pushing yourself to learn to write better.Meetings: Include the primary goal of the meeting in your invite, ideally along with an agenda. If you attend a meeting that doesn’t feel productive, point it out. Invite as few people as possible. Leave with clear action items. Follow up over email with the action items and owners. Read How to Run a Quarterly Product Strategy Meeting by Gibson Biddle.Presentations: Are you sure you need to do a presentation versus an email? Make sure your audience knows the goal of the presentation — are you looking for a decision or general feedback, or purely sharing information? It’s not as obvious as you think. Get feedback on your presentation; fresh eyes always catch the glaring issues. And keep it short — no one ever wished that presentation went longer.Storytelling: This is a meta-skill that will make you better at all of the above. This framework is an excellent tool for laying out your pitch, and a few more helpful guides can be found here and here.4. Leadership through influence 🤝Generally, PMs have all of the responsibility without any actual authority. It’s a tough and rather unusual gig. But when it works however, it’s extremely fulfilling. In order to succeed you need to be able to build trust with your teammates, make decisions but also give everyone a voice, and keep morale up no matter what’s going on. The best PMs quickly become the de-facto leaders of the team, not because of any actual authority, but because they help everyone on the team do the best work of their lives.[A great product manager] is both trusting and trustworthy. She knows the difference between trust and blind faith, and invests in building a working environment where people have each others’ backs. She sets an example with her own behavior and works from the assumption that people have good intentions. She listens and always strives to understand others’ context, point of view and perspective.— Lawrence RipsherSome recommendations for developing your product leadership skills:Watch PMs around you closely — how do they get things done when they don’t actually manage anyone on the team?Find a small project that you can lead, ideally working closely with a PM mentorFoster culture within whatever team you are on.

Making decisions, informed by data 👍Teams generally look to the PM to help them reach decisions. Expect to be making dozens of decisions on behalf of the team daily. Your best friend in making decisions is a clear set of principles you aligned on previously, and hard data (both quantitative and qualitative). The less opinions you have to rely on, and the more facts you have at your disposal, the easier your life gets.The decisions PMs make are the ones that unblock their team so they can continue to build. They don’t need to make every decision, but they are responsible for ensuring a decision gets made — whether by them, their team, or their stakeholders. Product managers are the hedge against indecision.— Brandon ChuSome recommendations for developing your decision-making skills:Study how successful companies make decisions through experimentation (Airbnb, Uber, Netflix, Pinterest), and find a way to launch an experiment or two where you work todayWatch successful leaders around you make decisions — how quickly are they making decisions, what do they ask about before making a decision, how do they communicate their reasoning?Always have a perspective on a decision (your own POV), but also be ready to change your mind given new informationRead about Type-1 and Type-2 decisionsRead Making Good Decisions as a Product Manager by Brandon ChuRead The Art of Decision Making as a Product Manager by Sachin RekhiRead The Agony and Ecstasy of Building with Data by Julie ZhuoRead Your Job is Not to Make Every Possible Customer Happy by Steve BlankRead Product strategy means saying no by Des Traynor6. Building great products, and having taste 👌At the end of the day you are building a product for other people, and so you’ll want to build some experience doing this. All of the other skills above play into this, but there are a few unique skills to develop here, including building an instinct for what makes a product great, how to find the balance between art and science, and how to best work with other disciplines.Product intuition is a skill: it is the observation of human behavior, trained by data, and applied to software.— Merci Victoria GraceSome recommendations for developing your product sense:Find a way to build a product yourself or with friends, and get it out into the world. Find a small problem and try to solve it for someone (or yourself). There’s absolutely no better way to learn than to do it yourself.Learn to notice what makes you like and not like a product.

Always being prepared 😎In my opinion, one of the most underrated yet most valuable traits for a PM to have is what I call the “I got this” aura. Everyone should feel that if you take something on it will get done, and done exceptionally well. The key to building this aura is to become increasingly detail oriented, to be more prepared than anyone else, and to have a higher bar than those around you. I personally started off being very bad at this, and saw a lot of growth in my career once I prioritized these skills.[Great PMs] say what they’ll do, and then do what they say. Their follow-through is impeccable, and they don’t let details slip. When they join a team, quality and pace seems to dramatically improve overnight.— Noah WeissSome recommendations for developing your “I got this” aura:Never come to a meeting without spending at least a few minutes preparing and collecting your thoughtsKeep a high bar for everything you do — re-read the recommendations in item #3 above (Communication)Build your “spidey sense.” Look ahead and around corners. What could go wrong and how can you prepare? Plan for contingencies.

My advice is to start developing and demonstrating the skills I outlined above. Read, process, and put your learnings into action however you can (creativity is part of being a PM). Your job is to be as prepared as possible when an opportunity arises. As you do this, push forward on one or two of the paths I suggested. This may take a year or two or three. If you’re not getting anywhere, try another route. Meet PMs, listen to their feedback, and act. If you truly believe this is the right role for you, find a way.If I missed anything, if you disagree with anything, or if you have any questions — don’t hesitate to tweet me. 🥳Sincerely,LennyBig thank you to Yelena, Ben, Isabel, Godfrey, Galen, and Craig for reviewing drafts of this post. 🙏"},{"title":"How to kickstart and scale a marketplace business","article":"“Everyone's always looking for the hack - what's the channel that will unlock something big? But every time we looked for a reason we weren't growing, it always came back to the basics –– selection, delivery quality, pricing. That's it. Always come back to first principles. Whenever we made a mistake, we forgot this.”– Micah Moreau (DoorDash, VP of Growth)(This is a special edition of my newsletter — the first in a series of posts sharing insights from interviews with founders and early employees at today’s most successful marketplace businesses. Our regularly scheduled weekly Q&A series will resume in a few weeks.)Having worked at Airbnb for many years, I’m frequently asked about what Airbnb did right in order to grow into what it is today. While sharing my learnings, I’ve become increasingly wary of teams relying too heavily on a single company’s experience. There are so many factors that go into an eventual success story, and what’s effective once may not be again. Thus, I’ve been yearning to get a wider perspective on what has (and hasn’t) worked for other marketplace companies.Since I couldn’t find anything out there that was comprehensive enough, I decided to be the change I want to see in the world and do the primary research myself. Over the past few months, I’ve had the good fortune to interview dozens of incredible people with direct experience building and scaling some of the most successful marketplace companies in the world. I’ve consolidated their learnings into a sort-of-playbook to kickstart and grow a successful marketplace business — which I’ll be sharing as bite-sized posts over the next few weeks:How to Kickstart and Scale a Marketplace BusinessPhase 1: Crack the chicken-and-egg problem 🐣Part 1: Constrain the marketplace 🔬 (this post)Part 2: Decide which side of the marketplace to concentrate on 🧐Part 3: Drive initial supply 🐥Part 4: Drive initial demand 👋Phase 2: Scale your marketplace 📈Part 1: Determine if you are supply or demand constrained 🤹‍♂️Part 2: Scale growth levers 🔥Part 3: Maintain quality 🏅Part 4: What would you have done differently if you did it again 🔮Phase 3: Evolve your marketplace 🐛Part 1: Move to a managed marketplace 🕹Part 2: Add new business lines 🍰This work would not have been possible without the enormous generosity of countless people, all willing to share their precious time, stories, and insights with me simply because I asked. The readiness to share so openly and transparently says a lot about the value people in the tech industry place on sharing and giving back. A very special thank you to Andrew Chen (ex-growth at Uber, GP at a16z), Babak Nivi (co-founder of AngelList), Benjamin Lauzier (ex-growth at Lyft, Director of Product at Thumbtack), Brian Rothenberg (ex-growth at Eventbrite and TaskRabbit, Partner at defy), Casey Winters (ex-growth at GrubHub, CPO at Eventbrite), Dan Hockenmaier (ex-growth at Thumbtack, founder of Basis One), Dan McKinley (ex-Etsy, Principal Engineer at MailChimp), David Rosenthal (ex-Rover, GP at Wave Capital), Georg Bauser (ex-Airbnb, CEO of Expansion Partners), Gilad Horev (VP Product at Eventbrite), Gokul Rajaram (Caviar Lead), Gustaf Alströmer (ex-growth at Airbnb, partner at YC), Hunter Walk (partner at Homebrew), Jamie Viggiano (ex-marketing at TaskRabbit, CMO at Fuel Capital), Julien Smith (co-founder of Breather), Kati Schmidt (ex-Airbnb), Max Mullen (co-founder Instacart), Micah Moreau (VP Growth at DoorDash), Mike Duboe (ex-growth at Stitch Fix, investor at Greylock), Mike Xenakis (ex-SVP of Product at OpenTable, Lecturer at Kellogg School of Management), Nickey Skarstad (ex-Director of Product at Etsy, VP of Product at The Wing), Nate Moch (VP at Zillow), Sander Daniels (co-founder of Thumbtack), Tal Raviv (growth at Patreon), and Tamara Mendelsohn (VP and GM at Eventbrite). Unless otherwise stated, all of the quotes below come from my direct interviews.BackgroundWhat is a marketplace business, anyway?A marketplace business is one that (1) connects demand (i.e. people who want a thing) with (2) supply (i.e. people who have that thing), and (3) leads to a financial transaction. These businesses do not generally own any supply, do not provide products or services directly, and (eventually) handle the money being exchanged. Simply put, their job is to provide a platform where the supply and demand efficiently find each other and transact successfully.Examples of classic marketplace businesses: Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, Alibaba, eBay, Etsy, Hipcamp, DoorDash, Caviar, Rover, Postmates, Thumbtack, TaskRabbit, CraigslistExamples of non-marketplace businesses: Delta Airlines (they own all of the inventory), YouTube (no financial transaction), Slack (no supply).Why are marketplaces great businesses?Network effects: The more users you get, the more useful/cheap your product becomes, the more users you get (e.g. Lyft/Uber vs. taxis)Barrier to entry: Once they have a strong network effect, it becomes increasingly difficult to enter or replicate the marketplace (e.g. Airbnb vs. hotels)Efficiency: No inventory means cheaper to operate (e.g. Airbnb vs. hotels)Scalability: No inventory means easier to scale (e.g. Rover vs. dog hotels)Flexibility:  No inventory means easier to pivot (e.g. Uber Black -> Uber X)Important disclaimersFor many of these companies, the primary reason they became successful was not because of some amazing growth insights – it was primarily because of great product/market fit. Many folks I spoke to are first to admit this. The growth levers they employed helped accelerate (and control) growth, but they may have been successful anyway. At least for a while.Past behavior is not predictive of future behavior. When reading through the lessons below, my advice is to focus more on ways of thinking and the cleverness behind the ideas –– not only the specific tactics. Many of the most successful growth levers of the past no longer work, or are significantly less effective. Take inspiration from what you read, but don’t expect them to work the same way for you.This research is based on interviews, of events many years ago. Memory can be faulty, takeaways could be anecdotal, and you often don’t really know what mattered in the end. Also, I probably got some stuff wrong, so please don’t take any of this as gospel (and I’ll include any corrections in future posts). All that being said, I’ve tried my best to triangulate what actually happened across multiple sources, and made sure things felt right.With those caveats in mind, let’s dive in!How to Build a Marketplace BusinessPhase 1: Crack the chicken-and-egg problem 🐣Once a marketplace business is operating, supply (i.e. restaurants, homes, drivers) happily serve demand (i.e. eaters, travelers, passengers). However, when your marketplace is just getting started, and you have neither supply nor demand, it’s challenging to get the flywheel going. You must convince one side of the marketplace to commit before the other side. For example, without restaurants onboard, a customer looking for food has no reason to check your app. And without customers using your app, restaurants have very little reason to spend time onboarding onto your platform. This is known as the “chicken-and-egg problem”, and solving it is one of the biggest barriers to launching a marketplace business. Below, and over the next few posts, we’ll walk through the steps that the biggest marketplaces worked through in order to crack this problem. Also, here’s a cheat sheet:Step 1: Constrain the marketplace 🔬The first major learning that emerged from this research is that, with the exception of one company, every single marketplace that I interviewed constrained their initial marketplace to more quickly get to critical mass. To some this may seem counter-intuitive — why limit your growth and opportunities when you are starting out? It turns out that the best way to get big is by first going small.The research points to two ways to constrain a marketplace: (1) by geography, and (2) by category. If the offering requires supply and demand to be in the same physical location, the constraint is always geographical (e.g. a limited set of markets). Otherwise, it’s category-based (e.g. handmade goods). And the one exception to this rule, Thumbtack, is a fascinating case study in and of itself.If the service requires supply and demand to meet, it always started with a geographical constraint (i.e. a single market)Rover:“We started in Seattle, and stayed hyper-focused on Seattle, for a while. Seattle was the perfect market for us: very dog-friendly, early adopters, techy, working professionals who go on vacation and business trips. Plus Amazon is super dog-friendly. There is probably no more dog-friendly city in America. This helped figure out the product quickly.”— David Rosenthal Airbnb:“Similar to how the founders first focused on New York early on, when Airbnb expanded internationally in 2011, we focused on creating critical mass in just a few markets in which we were quickly able to unlock supply and demand.”— Kati SchmidtUber:“We created a playbook for opening up a new market, which got set by the Launcher team (led by Austin Geidt). The first thing they would do when they launched market is to figure out supply. The goal was to get over 30 drivers, shooting for ETA of less than 15 minutes.”— Andrew ChenOpenTable:“We ultimately discovered if we had enough restaurants in a market, we’d have enough value for the diner to use OpenTable. Dining is local, so concentration was key. A rule of thumb was that if we could get to 50-100 concentrated restaurants in a city, we had enough for a consumer to land on the site, cast a wide net, and get a consideration set that was meaningful enough to not be disappointed.”— Mike XenakisInstacart:“We selected our initial markets where there would likely be demand, e.g. Chicago in the winter. A high household income, fewer households with cars, and frequently inclement weather — typically means people want delivery.”— Max MullenBreather:“When transaction length was low (a 2 hour room booking), proximity was super important. We had areas of density like the Flatiron District, where we added units and they kept getting booked immediately. It was clear product/market fit. We followed this in a super dense and a very precise way. This cafe, at this location, at this time, is working. Duplicate this exactly. Don’t try to create something else. Don’t try to launch a new city yet. Don’t change anything. What is the exact same thing I can duplicate or extend? What else can this customer go do after? How can I double the size of the transaction. A lesson of marketplace companies --  if you are in a place with a decent market size, then just double down on what’s working. You don’t need to do anything new. Like with Airbnb, it was working in NY, so just create that again and again and again.”— Julien SmithZillow:“When we started the mortgage marketplace, there were no automated systems for anonymous, accurate, real time mortgage rates. So we had to start small in a single market and work with mortgage brokers who would respond to emails and manually enter quotes by hand every day.”— Nate MochEssentially every other marketplace (not location-based) started with a category constraint:TaskRabbit:“While we were always a broad platform, we were very deliberate about building a liquid marketplace for our most popular task categories, which were and continue to be: handyman tasks (including IKEA assembly), house cleaning, and moving help. We focused on these categories to ensure that there was high-quality supply to meet the consumer demand for these services.”— Jamie ViggianoEventbrite:“Find your core use-case, and gain traction there. For Eventbrite, this was tech mixers and conferences. As you got invites from events, you started to see the name Eventbrite over and over and it became a thing. We focused on this, based on seeing where most early traction was.”— Brian Rothenberg Etsy:“From the beginning, we had only three categories of things you could sell: vintage items, craft supplies, and handmade items.”— Etsy, Dan McKinleyIn one rare, fascinating, and deliberate case, Thumbtack decided to eschew any constraint:“The conventional wisdom was to narrow focus to a category (like Amazon did with books) or geography (like Yelp did with San Francisco). We didn't get funding for many years in part because we did the opposite -- we did all categories and all geographies from the beginning. People thought that wouldn't work, that we were boiling the ocean. In retrospect it was the only way to build a marketplace in our space at scale -- being broad in category increased the frequency of use of our product from once every couple years (how often do you need to hire a house painter?) to 8-12 times a year (the number of Thumbtack services an average American household hires annually). And being broad in geography allowed us to scale our marketplace as fast as possible, giving us the revenue, traffic, and thus experimental velocity we needed to bootstrap a great product. In our case we wouldn't have survived had we done it any other way.”— Sander DanielsOnce you’ve decided how to constrain your marketplace, you then need to pick which side of the marketplace to put most of your resources behind (supply or demand). In our next post, learn how today’s biggest marketplace companies decided whether to concentrate on supply vs. demand early-on, plus how one “marketplace” realized they weren’t a marketplace after all.Other posts:Part 1: Constrain the marketplace 🔬 (this post)Part 2: Decide which side of the marketplace to concentrate on 🧐Part 3: Drive initial supply 🐥Part 4: Drive initial demand 👋Subscribe"},{"title":"Getting better at product strategy","article":"Hello, I’m Lenny and welcome to a 🔒 subscriber-only edition 🔒 of my newsletter.

We all know you start as an individual contributor, and eventually, you can become a CPO or a VP of Product. But what happens in the middle? The answer is that you go through three milestones:You become a “senior” IC PM (the focus of this post)You become a manager of PMs, usually called a Group PM, or Product LeadYou become a manager of PM managers, usually called a DirectorIn my experience, of these three milestones, it takes the longest to progress through the first milestone, going from an entry-level PM to a senior PM. I’d guess that the median amount of time is 3 years, followed by 1-2 years to become a manager of PMs, and another 2-3 to become a Director.Thus, if you can accelerate getting to Senior PM, you’ll have the most impact on accelerating your overall PM career. To help you down this journey, I asked Jackie Bavaro (author of Cracking the PM Interview, and just-released-last-week Cracking the PM Career) to share her wisdom on the topic with us. Jackie’s been knee-deep in research on the product management career path over the past couple of years (for her new book), so I couldn’t think of a better person to tackle this topic.Below you’ll find the best framing I’ve come across for what to focus on to level up into a Senior PM, including templates and tactical advice. I’m excited to share it with you all. Let’s dive in.Becoming a senior Product Managerby Jackie BavaroAs an early-career PM, it can be hard to understand what it takes to become a “senior” PM, and how to get there. That’s because senior PMs don’t actually need to be much better than a regular PM at the kind of work a regular PM does. The biggest differences are behind the scenes.Here’s an example, based on an interview question you’ll probably recognize:A PM designs an alarm clock for the blind. They interview customers, test prototypes, and work closely with marketing to successfully launch the new product.A senior PM discovers the market opportunity for more accessible alarm clocks while speaking to customers and partners during their day-to-day work. They create a strategic plan to win the market, analyze which audience to address first, and convince executives to spin up a new team. Then, they interview customers, test prototypes, and work closely with marketing to successfully launch the new product.Teammates of the senior PM might not see any of that strategic planning. If they only look at specs and product choices, they might not understand why that person got the promotion.The three most important differentiators of senior PMs are:StrategyAutonomyNuanceLet’s explore each of these skills.StrategyA senior PM is responsible for developing and evangelizing a strategy that leads to meaningful customer and business success.They paint a picture of an inspiring future and figure out the best path to get there. They ensure that people understand the strategy and agree with it. They advocate for the resources they need, convincing executives to spin up the necessary teams.Newer PMs tend to prioritize work based on how much incremental value it adds to the product, while senior PMs prioritize work based on how much it moves the product towards the long term vision. For example, the top requested feature might be great for delighting the current customer base, but it could be more strategic to focus on features that expand the customer base.By focusing on strategy, senior PMs are able to reliably deliver great products that make a big impact for customers and the business.The first step down this path is to make space for strategic work. You don’t need a promotion to start creating strategies – go ahead and make a proposal for what your team should work on next.If you keep your eyes open for strategic insights during your day-to-day work, it often doesn’t take much time to get started on a strategy. Block off half a day and pretend you’re attending a (zoom) wedding if you need to. If you really can’t find the time because your engineering team needs you that much, you’ll need to first level up your core PM skills so that the day-to-day work goes faster.There are three parts to a strategy: (1) vision, (2) strategic framework, and (3) roadmap. You can get started with whichever one calls to you:To get started with a vision, sketch out a storyboard of your future customers using your future product and highlight how much better their lives are compared to the status quo. I like to model my product vision after an infomercial, spending a while to explain just how painful things are today. Make sure to include a few strategic insights or bets so that the vision feels believable.Ouch! I stepped on a lego brick. It’s so hard to get kids to clean up their toys. I hate being the mean mom who’s always telling them to clean up. Imagine a future where cleaning up toys is a game and your kids race to be the fastest!To get started with a strategic framework, write down your target market, their pain points, and the strategic bets or differentiators that you believe will win that market. Write down some alternative approaches and lay out your frameworks for why you believe your approach is better.With the growing trend of positive parenting, parents are looking for ways to inspire good behavior in their children without resorting to punishments. We should enter this market with a fun game that solves one of the top pain points (putting away toys, picky eating, staying in bed at bedtime), and expand into the other pain points over time. By launching a game (instead of a tool or a book), we expand the market beyond parents to anyone who wants to buy the child a gift.To get started with the roadmap, write down a rough plan for the next few year’s worth of work, ideally grouped into strategic themes. Once you have the roadmap, imagine someone asking \"why?\" about each part of it. Your answers to that question will form the beginning of your strategic framework.This quarter: launch cleaning game. Next quarter: launch picky food game. Next half: launch 2 more games. Next year: start licensing new games to expand faster.Your strategy doesn’t have to be perfect! Your plan will change as you learn new information, but starting with a strategy helps you make better moves now. Block off the time to create a strategy now!AutonomySenior PMs are able to run a team independently. Great senior PMs ask for lots of input and advice, but they could keep their team running, work with stakeholders, resolve conflicts, and ship successful products without needing their manager to guide them. They know when to question the direction they were handed, rather than seeing it as a fixed variable. Autonomy isn’t just about being capable, it’s also about earning the trust to be allowed to work independently. That takes proactive communication and building a track record of successful launches. Ironically, if you have a high level of autonomy it can be harder to earn trust. When you’re working independently, your manager won’t see all of the great decisions you make and the tough challenges you overcome. You’ll need to intentionally share your work with your manager.A lot can go astray when you try to share your work with your manager. You might sound too self-promotional, they might think you’re stuck and asking for advice, they might be frustrated that you’re not asking for advice.Luckily, there’s a template that helps avoid all these problems:Hi manager, let me tell you about a challenge I ran into ______Here’s how I’m thinking of handling it (or did handle it) ______Any thoughts?This format lets you show off the challenge you faced and how you handled it, while also making an opening for feedback. If your solution was good, your manager can tell you, \"Great work!\" If there’s room for improvement, proactively asking for feedback at least demonstrates that you can be trusted to ask for input when you need it.Try to use this template the next time you want to share your progress or ask your manager for advice.NuanceThe more senior you get, the more you’ll be faced with decisions where the right answer is “it depends.”Senior PMs recognize these decisions and reason through them in a structured way. They can grapple with complex tradeoffs and ambiguous situations. They don’t fall back on rigid frameworks. They understand the goals and constraints of departments across the company and don't erroneously assume that their own team's goals are more important than those of any other team.This doesn’t mean that it takes a senior PM days to make each decision. Due to their product expertise and rich mental models, they can lay out their thought process in minutes. Given an ambiguous problem area, they can rapidly pick out the most important problems to solve (and drive the work through to tangible impact).As a corollary to working on these nuanced problems, senior PMs also are expected to engage in constructive discussions with leaders at the company. They can effectively explain the nuance in the situation and the tradeoffs. They can defend their recommendation without becoming defensive.As you work on developing your nuanced thinking, the best guides are your teammates and stakeholders. Take their concerns seriously and look for the hidden complexity. What are the circumstances in which they’d be right? What information might they have that causes them to come to a different conclusion?As an example, imagine you’re launching a new feature and the head of customer support complains that it can’t be controlled by her team’s operational scripts. Instead of brushing her off and saying you'll update the scripts after launch, ask questions until you understand why she cares. You might learn that without the scripts it takes customer support representatives longer to answer tickets, which means customers will have a lower satisfaction rating, which correlates with them canceling their subscription. Once you see the broader implications, you might decide it's better to delay the launch until the scripts are updated.To practice this skill, when you make a decision, find nuances where a different decision would be better. Write out, “It depends. If X, then A is the best choice. If Y, then B is the best choice. I think this situation is X, so A.” While it's helpful to explore \"it depends,\" only share that longer answer if it's actually helpful. You don't want to annoy your teammates. In summary, start these three things today:Block off the time on your calendar to focus on strategyUse the autonomy template in your next meeting with your managerLook for the “it depends” answer to practice onBy working on strategy, autonomy, and nuance, you can level up your skills, expand your impact, and hopefully get promoted to senior PM! In our new book Cracking the PM Career, Gayle and I go into even more detail on the senior PM role and what it means to be strategic.  If you have more thoughts or questions, the best way to reach me is @jackiebo on Twitter.Thanks, Jackie!🔥 Job opening of the week: BubbleGrowth Manager - AcquisitionWe're looking for a senior growth marketer to help us scale our paid channels at Bubble.

Taking all of these insights, including input from the first PM of Superhuman, Lyft, Airbnb, Front, Patreon, and many other great companies, I’ve synthesized the most concrete and consistent pieces of advice below. Here’s a summary:Listen and learnBecome the expert on the productForm your own opinionsBuild trust with the CEOBuild trust with the teamAlign expectationsFind balanceBefore we get into the concrete suggestions, let’s look into when to hire your first PM, and what to expect from the role.When to hire your first PMKen Norton (early PM at Google):“When do you go from PM Zero to PM One? Many of the founders I’ve worked with are surprised when my recommendation is often not yet. Usually I discourage them from hiring until they’ve found product/market fit. But even when you’re hitting your growth phase, the danger of having too many cooks in the kitchen exceeds the cost of being overworked. A starvation diet when it comes to PMs is preferable to being overstuffed. Surprisingly, your team may tell you when it’s time, although not in so many words. Here are some signals they’ll send:“You’re slowing us down.”“You’re detached from the details.”“The rest of our business needs you.”Jonathan Golden (first PM at Airbnb):“My advice is that it’s time to hire your first product manager when all three of the following are met:You’ve achieved product/market fit and need to scaleYour engineering team is greater than seven peopleYou are mentally ready to let someone else control the roadmap at some levelThis stage normally happens right after a Series A financing. The team sees the work ahead of them and the founder realizes that her number-one priority needs to be hiring for and building out other functions of the business.”Tim Wood (first PM at Patreon):“The less experience founders have building products, the sooner it should be. On the other hand, if the founder is an ex-PM and the engineers and/or designers are product-oriented, a company could get by for quite awhile without a dedicated PM.”What to expect as a first PM“The first PM is an extremely challenging role. You’re gonna have a lot of tough battles, and the second PM is gonna owe you a ton for how easy they’ll have it”ー Anonymous“The amount of ambiguity facing a 1st time PM is tremendous. Often the founders/execs are still extremely hands on and aren’t comfortable sharing ownership. So there’s a lot of tension. Your job is to bring clarity and focus (i.e. decrease ambiguity) yet stay extremely flexible to changing things all over again every six months. PMs help get ambiguity under control in critical areas + let it exist in others.”ー Ben Erez (first PM at Abstract)“Roll up your sleeves, be a team player. I had to wear many hats – QA, user research, API documentation, marketing, BD – to move the team fwd. While in other companies, you have someone in each role, you have to do it all at early stage. I loved it, but it's not for everyone.”— Karan Ahuja (first PM at Tally)Now, let’s dive in.How to succeed as the first PM1. Listen and learn “First, take time to observe, listen, learn how & why things are done. You have but a short time to just be there before you need to do things. Make the most of it!” ー Ketki Duvvuru (first PM at Superhuman)“Spend your first month really focused on developing understanding and empathy. Sit down with as many of your new coworkers as you can, and understand:How does the product development process work today, and how can it be improved?Who has been serving as the PM to date? Was it solely the CEO, or has an engineer or salesperson been calling some of the shots without a PM in place?” ー Evan Goldin (first PM at Lyft, Chariot)“Don't upset the apple cart. You're joining a company that clearly has had some success: they are growing and as you say, have PMF with a core product. Your instinct will be to quickly change things, both because there's improvements that seem obvious but also because you'll want to show value (they hired you for your product expertise, right?!). This is a mistake I see many executives who are hired into smaller companies make. These bigger moves upset the apple cart and because the product leader (or executive) didn't generate the trust from the founder, or made mistakes in these bigger moves because of lacking context, it ends up as a disaster. Move slower than you think. While many of those things initially will come to pass, instead of focusing on what isn't going right, look to what is working and why: can you build upon those process and make them slightly better/more efficient? Can you expand into something that's closely related (process or features)? These initial successes will both engender trust from the founders as well as give you more context and confidence to make the bigger changes you want (and likely will need) to make after your first 3-6 months on the job.”— Nate Abbott (Head of Product at Front)2. Become the expert on the product“As for any product manager, invest deeply in getting to know your customer really really well”— Ketki Duvvuru (first PM at Superhuman)“Understand your product, your customers and your competition. Within 3 months, you should know about all the nooks and crannies of your product, and you should know it better than anyone else at the company. Talk to your product’s top fans, and really understand why they use the product. Screenshot and document the key flows and features your competitors offer.” ー Evan Goldin (first PM at Lyft, Chariot)“OWN the product... live in it. Live with the support staff, observe customers using it, help with QA and test it. Know it better than everyone else.”ー Mark Leck3.

Below, you’ll find:Which skills matter most when hiring PMsWhat PMs have to get most right to get promotedHow much influence PMs haveWhich companies prioritize Heart vs. Head vs. HandsTakeaways, and links to dig deeperA big thank you to PMHQ, Sriram Krishnan, Hiten Shah, Josh Elman, Ian McAllister for helping amplify this survey to get more responses, and to Tal Raviv, Manik Gupta, Helen Sims, AJ Frank, Matthias Wagner, Kara Skrip, Sean Lynch, Peter Sauer, and Kiyani Bamba for feedback on the survey and post.A few quick disclaimers:I’m no survey expert. I may have gotten something wrong. Please forgive me if so, and please give me feedback.85% of the responders were product managers (as planned), so assume bias from that perspective.When I mention specific companies below, I made sure to have at least two data points from that company.Let’s dive in!Who took the surveyBeing a Product ManagerTakeaways:Most frequently valued: Communication, execution, product senseLeast frequently valued: Design/UX, empathy, raw intelligenceTakeaways:Companies who spike on Communication: HubSpot, SalesforceCompanies who spike on Execution: Salesforce, Tesla, VMwareCompanies who spike on Product sense: Asana, Flipkart, Intercom, Netflix, ServiceNow, WhatsAppCompanies who spike on Strategic thinking: Coinbase, Stripe, ZillowCompanies who spike on Collaboration: Atlassian, Box, ServiceNow, Spotify, TwitterCompanies who spike on Data acumen: Quora, Reddit, ZyngaCompanies who spike on Technical background: Oracle, StripeCompanies who spike on Raw intelligence: Coinbase, RobinhoodCompanies who spike on Empathy: HubSpot, IntercomCompanies who spike on Design/UX: WhatsAppGetting promotedTakeaways:Showing significant impact on the business — by far the most common thing to get rightUnlike the mini-CEO label PMs often get, in reality they must keep their external stakeholders onboard to be successfulKeeping their team and manager happy — less of a priority at most companies, but as you’ll see below, very important at someTakeaways:Companies who prioritize Showing significant business impact: Atlassian, Capital One, Coinbase, Expedia, HubSpot, Netflix, Square, Wayfair, Yelp, YouTube, ZillowCompanies who prioritize Keeping stakeholders onboard: Atlassian, Booking, IBM, VMware, Wayfair, ZillowCompanies who prioritize Hitting goals: Airbnb, Reddit, Yelp, Zynga Companies who prioritize Shipping great product: Adobe, Hubspot, Intercom, Robinhood, Stripe, WhatsAppCompanies who prioritize Making their manager happy: Apple, IBM, Oracle Companies who prioritize Keeping their team happy: Intercom, Quora, VisaInfluenceTakeaways:According to responders (mostly PMs), PMs have more influence than other functions at over 80% of companiesSimilarly, PMs have “a lot more” influence at ~50% of companiesAlmost no companies have PMs with a lot less influence than other functionsLooking at this same data but excluding responses from product managers (e.g. only looking at responses from engineers, designers, CEOs, etc.), the story shifts a bit:Takeaways:From this perspective, we find that PMs have more influence than other functions at only 70% of companies (vs. 80% above). Clearly, PMs believe they have more influence than their teammates think they do.However, most of the variance comes from the number of responders who believe PMs run the show — ~13% when looking at all responses, but only ~6% when PM responses are excluded.In both cases, roughly the same percentage of companies have PMs with slightly more, or a lot more, influence (~65%).Takeaways:The spectrum varies widely: from Zynga where PMs run the show, to Apple where PMs have the least influenceNoteworthy companies where PMs have a lot more influence: YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, Uber, Robinhood, Lyft, Coinbase, Asana, AirbnbNoteworthy companies where PMs have relatively less influence: Apple, Oracle, Stripe, TeslaHeart vs. Hands vs. HeadIt's often said that companies are defined by how they index on Heart (e.g. empathy, culture) vs. Hands (e.g. execution) vs. Head (e.g. intelligence).

Each week I tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out about work.SubscribeI’m kicking off a new series where I share how the most effective product teams build product. I’m often asked how to structure one’s product development process. What better way to learn than by studying best-in-class companies?I’m excited to launch this series with Figma, one of the most innovative, interesting, and impactful product teams today. I reached out to Yuhki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma, and he very kindly agreed to answer my (many) questions. As CPO, Yuhki leads the product and design teams at Figma. Before joining Figma, he was at Uber for over four years, where he led the redesign of both the rider and driver apps. Prior to that, at Google, he was responsible for the YouTube app on iOS. Thank you for sharing, Yuhki 🙏How Figma builds product1. How far out do you plan in detail, and how has that evolved over the years?Every year, the leadership team sets high-level company priorities to frame key strategic investments. It’s then up to product teams to chart out the path to reach those goals.A bigger planning cycle happens twice a year, with product teams revisiting their own goals and roadmaps. Halfway through each half—or in the alternating quarters—teams have an opportunity to adjust those plans based on learnings and new information.Planning cycles haven’t changed too much over the years. They’ve been roughly quarterly in the beginning, but over time, we began formalizing things a bit more, where there was a cadence for different altitudes (annual company priorities, larger half planning, and quarterly refreshes/adjustments).Here’s a link to our Roadmap Review Template on FigJam, which is essentially how we do planning:I partner with Lawrence Luk (our Technical Program Manager) on leading the planning process. Lawrence comes up with the process, and together we handle the comms and implementation.2. Do you use OKRs (e.g. objectives, key results, 70% goals, etc.) in some form?We’ve had a fun relationship with OKRs.When I first arrived at Figma, I actually deprecated OKRs. We had dreadful companywide OKR meetings where we went through a spreadsheet tracker of hundreds of OKRs that were really more like tasks assigned to individual contributors. While it was good at creating some level of accountability, it was hard to understand why any of this mattered. I asked teams to instead define headlines—essentially, claims that they’d like to make by the end of some time period. For example, it might be something like “Figma is the most efficient way to design,” and the team offers both quantitative and qualitative ways to evaluate that claim. This helped me understand what a team was philosophically going for. It produced the right debates, and it allowed teams to be a bit more creative around how to measure whether they’ve achieved that headline (e.g. a combination of a variety of metrics and qualitative signals). It recognized the reality that some things, like the core experience of Figma, are hard to measure and can’t be reduced to a single metric; it gave room for teams to invest in a roadmap of exploring different KPIs versus artificially elevating a metric that ultimately people didn’t believe actually mattered.Once we hired a data-science leader, we brought OKRs back and have iterated on this format a bit. In some areas, we’ve become more sophisticated with metrics. In other areas, they still can be a bit more qualitative. Importantly, we’ve tried to keep constructs that allow for us to check on the philosophical alignment. And we’ve played around with branding OKRs more as a “commitment” to make sure that teams actually felt responsible for achieving these goals (versus it just feeling like the technical measurement of success but not something teams are indexed on day-to-day).Our OKR process is actually run on FigJam. We have teams write “commitments” (our rebranded OKRs) in these widgets that Lawrence made:3. How do your product/design review meetings work?We have design crits and product reviews. Design crits are intended to be very generative, and are explicitly not about making decisions. Designers share a file (often on FigJam), and we spend 10 minutes heads-down silently leaving stickies and comments to give feedback on the designs before discussing live.Product reviews are more about making decisions and debating directions. Here’s our template. We have different kinds: ones where we’re trying to align on the problem or ones where we’re trying to align on the solution. One thing I encourage for both is to first present the “option space”—it’s really powerful to have a framework that maps all possible solutions or problems and use that as a device to discuss high-level tradeoffs or philosophical differences. It’s been interesting to see the evolution of the format. When I arrived, people were projecting docs and there was more of a memo culture. I switched this format to decks, mostly because I wanted to push for more of a storytelling culture (and also so my PMs can use Figma more!). And recently we’ve been using FigJam more, because it allows for more of a two-way conversation and it’s easier to gauge people’s reactions. My favorite is adding the alignment widget, which lets people share/vote on their sentiments toward specific decisions; I find this so much more powerful than allowing the loudest people in the room to dictate the outcome!Example of us using the alignment widget4. For design crits, who comes to these meetings, who runs the meeting, and how often do you meet?Crits are a central part of our design culture at Figma. We have five standing slots each week, and attendance increases in size with each session over the week (e.g. Tuesdays are for tech pillars, Thursdays for Editor and Non-Editor teams, and Fridays are for all of design).Designers have control over booking them and inviting any additional teammates (beyond the pillars or teams already in attendance). We send out an automated reminder each week in Slack for sign-ups.For the larger crits, we also welcome guest “observers” from across the company. We believe it’s important for everyone to see how designers share ideas and offer feedback on projects. We encourage every employee to attend at least one crit per year, regardless of their role or position.Our crits are fairly structured, following a similar format and led by the presenting designer. Typically we get to two topics per meeting, with a rough agenda of:~10-15 minutes of presenting (we use Spotlight in FigJam, and attendees are welcome to comment while someone is presenting)~5 minutes of lingering questions~5 minutes of silent writing and commenting on the fileWe find that this format gives presenters a greater breadth of feedback, while offering a few different entry points for attendees.For more about crits, our Vice President of Design Noah Levin wrote about our process here.5. For product reviews, same question.These include all of product leadership, including Dylan Field, our CEO; project leads; and key decision makers. They happen somewhat ad hoc, but generally at critical milestones in a product’s lifecycle, and are typically facilitated by the PM whose product or work is being reviewed.6. How many PMs do you have?Twenty-two, and we’re hiring!7. Do you structure your product teams around products, user types, user journey, outcomes, or something in between? Has this changed over the years?This is also a fun debate!Right now, we organize around products and platforms. We have two products—Figma Design and FigJam—so we have two teams solely focused on the respective product. We then have “horizontal” platform teams that build features and solve problems across both products, e.g. the “Enterprise” group that focuses on making both of these products amazing for large enterprises and the “Infrastructure” group that ensures the reliability and performance of both products.This has changed a bit over the years, especially when we were a single-product company. At the time, teams were organized more around product surfaces (which roughly corresponded to use cases).Solving team structure is an art, not a science, and something that we expect to revisit continually as we grow.8. Are product and design part of the same org? Who do PMs ultimately report to, and has this changed over the years?"},{"title":"Managing up","article":"Q: I’m finding it tough to work with my manager. Do you have any advice for “managing up”?Managing up is one of the most essential skills at every level. Even as a CEO. It enables you to be less stressed, do your best work, and get the recognition that you deserve. Below are five tactics I’ve found to be most effective in managing up:1. 📢 Over-communicate Regularly share what you’re doing, what you plan to do, and what you’ve done with your manager. It’s nearly impossible to over-communicate. I suggest sending a simple weekly “State of The Me” email to your boss with (1) your current priorities, (2) things on your mind, and (3) blockers you need help with. Try it for two weeks — it’ll work wonders. Here’s a template you can use:You can also highlight material changes to your priorities from the prior week to make it even easier for your manager (h/t to Nishi Patel for the idea).2. 🤐 Set realistic expectationsWhen taking on work, set realistic expectations around time, resources need…"},{"title":"How to know when to stop","article":"👋 Hey, Lenny here! Welcome to a ✨ monthly free edition ✨ of my weekly newsletter.

Aren’t they the same people you are in the habit of calling crazy? And is this your life ambition, then—to win the approval of lunatics?”—EpictetusIn 2018, the universe sent me a sign saying, “Slow the fuck down!”I had recently been promoted to president at Wealthfront after 15 hard years of climbing the startup ladder. Yet after only a few months in my new position, I was in the emergency room with heart issues.After several tests, the doctors told me that my heart was like a lopsided tire. It worked, but it wobbled. Some parts of my heart were enlarged, and others had a thick, rigid texture that I imagine is like the low-quality meat you find in a bad bowl of pho.The cardiologist gave me the “You know how many 40-year-old CEOs I know who have heart attacks?” talk. Except I was only 35 at the time. I knew that I was constantly stressed out and exhausted from work. But I was unaware of just how fragile my health had become.He lectured me on what I needed to do moving forward. I needed more rest, more exercise, a better diet, and less stress. It’s advice that I already knew but that I ignored while in the “fog of war” of high-growth startups. Yet it was clear that I had had enough. So I stepped down and left the company to focus on my well-being.Systemic imbalanceIn retrospect, the signs were there that I was pushing too hard. I suspect the same is true for many of us in high-profile positions, high-profile startups, or high-stress industries. To help prove that, I decided to run a few surveys on LinkedIn.Nearly 50% of responders had thought about changing their careers at least three times due to it “not being worth it.” And another 50% had cried because of work at least twice. It seems commonplace within our work culture to push ourselves to a breaking point, whether it’s physical or psychological. Often it’s both, as our body and mind are intertwined. Nonetheless, as someone who was conditioned to always aim for the top, like many high achievers in the world of tech, I was having a hard time reconciling the limitations of my health with my professional ambitions.It was clear that I needed to make a trade-off to avoid a fate that others had faced, like the sad loss of the wonderful Dave Goldberg at the age of 47. It also required that I step back and make a holistic assessment of what matters to me. Not just with work but with the broader tapestry that makes up a complete life, including human connection and nurturing experiences.So I created a framework to do so. It has three parts:Define your personal range of tolerancePick your career progressionPick your life progressionI should have followed these steps earlier in my life. But because of my relentless, single-minded pursuit of success, I had to do so somewhat retroactively. I hope this framework will help you avoid my mistakes and establish a balanced life that allows you to thrive in many dimensions of life, not just the professional.Part 1: Define your range of toleranceStemming from my heart attack scare—a clear sign that I was overloaded—I began creating a plan to keep myself out of extended periods of unsustainable stress. That’s when I rediscovered the concept of a range of tolerance and started to apply it to myself.After a few years of iterating on it and pursuing it earnestly, it’s led to a quality of life that I wouldn’t trade for any salary. Here’s more on how it works.Where does life flourish?Life is found everywhere on the planet, but it is not evenly distributed. That’s because life has an optimal zone to survive and reproduce.For example, Atlantic salmon spend most of their adult life at sea, but they make an annual trek into freshwater to breed. Most other saltwater fish die quickly when placed in freshwater, but it’s a variable that the salmon are uniquely accustomed to.Source: Shelford’s law of toleranceStaying within a range of acceptable tolerance in your life should be the goal, so that you flourish in all dimensions, not just the professional. Taking on too much pushes us into zones of intolerance, where very little life can be sustained.How do I know if I’m outside my range of tolerance? When pushed outside our tolerance range, we will experience a wide range of indicators.One category of indicators is hormonal dysregulation, which reveals itself in the form of negative emotional states. We can feel irritable, anxious, sad, angry, withdrawn, or shut down.Source: Jade EmeryThe second category of indicators of unmanageable stress is physiological. Our natural bodily functions are interrupted, including the musculoskeletal, respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrinal, gastrointestinal, nervous, and reproductive systems.Lastly, we may adopt destructive behavioral patterns to soothe our emotional discomfort. We may develop addictions or compulsive activities as a coping mechanism due to excess stress. I know a lot of people who need a bottle or two of wine several nights a week in order to “unwind.” That’s not healthy behavior. Take an inventory of possible stress responsesIn the first few months of receiving therapy, I quickly wised up to all the ways in which my mind, body, and habits were telling me that I was on a bad path. My therapist sat me down and ran me through an inventory of my bodily sensations, taking note of my jaw and neck tension, tightness in my chest, shallow breathing, and huge bags under my eyes. Next, she dissected my habits and behaviors. She expertly pointed out all the ways in which my work routine had sidelined healthy habits and replaced them with unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as smoking pot at night in order to sleep. As the months and years went on, I became much more attuned to myself, which gave me the tools to assess how I was doing at any point in time. That turned out to be the first in a series of steps that I took to defend my health and know when to take a break.Based on what I learned through therapy, and in conjunction with comprehensive research on the subject of chronic stress, I created a simple questionnaire that you can copy and use yourself:Note that assessments like this can be subjective, so there isn’t a clear line in the sand that perfectly describes the state of your mental health. But they can be reliable indicators that someone may need to seek help. There are also publicly available tests that are clinically used and approved and can be taken for free. The Beck Depression Inventory is widely used, as is the Patient Health Questionnaire. With many of these tests, if you score near the midpoint of the total possible score, you’re entering a clinical level of depression that professionals would deem worthy of treatment.If you want to know more about the mind-body connection, Gabor Maté has an incredible lecture that discusses the relationship between trauma and our health. I suggest carving out an hour to give it a listen. He is one of the best in the world at discussing the human condition:Here’s what my stress response inventory looked like in 2017 when I was on the verge of peak burnout: I had checked 17 of 29 boxes, and I was still burning the candle at both ends. Eventually, I ended up in the hospital, which I could have avoided if I’d truly listened to what my body, mind, and behaviors were telling me.Each person has a unique range of toleranceWe must remember that when we approach our lives as if we have a limitless range of tolerance, or that our tolerance must be the same as our peers, we’re pursuing our life and our work in an inevitably unsustainable way. We’re all unique. Our biology, our circumstances, experiences, and the environment we are in will influence our range of tolerance.Biological and environmental factorsMy heart attack scare forced me to confront my biological limitations. It also helped me understand the direct connection between psychological trauma and physical illness. The doctors gave me a half-assed guess that “maybe it was genetic,” but every part of my ass knew that it was the by-product of excess stress on my nervous system, beginning with the PTSD induced by my early childhood experiences. Being not a complete idiot, and in deference to the substantial amount of research showing the connection between PTSD and cardiovascular disease, I listened to my doctors and stepped away from work. That was the beginning of admitting that my nervous system wasn’t cut out for the constant stress of a leadership role within the chaos of growing a startup.Even as I write this, from the comfort of a couch in a local coffee shop on a beautiful Sunday morning, my heart pounds, and my chest feels entombed with pressure. It’s not because of my present circumstances. It’s because of the shadow cast on the most primitive components of my brain by certain experiences I had as a kid that left me with an overactive nervous system.That’s the way it is for me. Conditioning and negative beliefsThe beliefs we hold can be very harmful and limit our ability to cope with challenging situations.A few examples of negative beliefs that I’ve commonly heard throughout tech:“I guess my coworkers manage stress better than I do.”“I have to accept feeling like this since it’s part of the job.”“I hate this feeling and just want it to disappear, but I don’t think it ever will.”Holding these beliefs can lead to further negative behaviors, such as withdrawal, avoidance, or even self-harm.﻿For example, there was a time when I called in sick at Twitter to avoid giving a five-minute presentation at the upcoming all-hands meeting. I was already sick with panic attacks, so the last thing I wanted to do was talk in front of a few hundred people. I decided to withdraw and bailed on my obligation to speak to the company. I told my boss that I had the flu. In my mind, I was conditioned to think that I needed to be perfect; otherwise, I wasn’t worthy of acceptance and love. Already in the grips of panic attacks, it was easy for me to believe that my presentation would be a failure, so I bailed on it before I gave myself a chance to prove otherwise. Create your tolerance listNow that you have taken an inventory of your current stress level, it’s time to come up with a plan to keep yourself within an acceptable range of tolerance as often as possible. It begins with creating a few lists: List of intolerables: A list of things to completely avoid. These are the variables that immediately place you outside a tolerable range and should be avoided. Think of experiences you’ve had that have produced a large emotional response that sent you into a downward spiral. Or things that you intuitively know are bad for your overall well-being. This may also include negative coping mechanisms such as substance abuse or behavioral patterns that directly impact your health, such as binging on junk food. List of boundaries: A list of self-imposed boundaries that are favorable toward health and well-being. These act as defensive measures to avoid the slippery slope into intolerable situations. For example, a boundary that promotes healthy behavior could be maintaining at least one active gym membership.Plan to flourish: A list of items that put you in your optimal zone of performance. You should be prepared to make sacrifices in order to commit to these. Think of experiences or behaviors that make you feel healthiest and at your best. These are the items that, when you commit to them, make you more resilient against things that test your tolerance.Here’s a table for creating your list. It is broken down into each major category of life to ensure that it is thorough and inclusive of a full life experience, not just our professional lives:As an example, here’s the current list that I use to organize my life. I tend to update it every 6-12 months, but this is the list that I’m using at this stage in my healing and this stage in my life and career. Create your tolerance targetOnce you have the list complete, transpose it into the tolerance target, which is a visual representation of the list you created: Items in the center red circle, you want to avoid at all costs. Items in the middle yellow circle are those that may be a slippery slope toward intolerable experiences and should be navigated mindfully. The outer green circle is where you want to dedicate your time, since that’s what encourages resiliency and allows you to flourish in all of life’s dimensions. This is what my current tolerance target looks like. I’ve hand-picked the items that resonate with me as “most true” when it comes to my own range of tolerance. I’d encourage you to do the same by trimming your list down to the items of greatest importance to you. For example, I once had a boss publicly mock me in front of my peers for not knowing how to write a very complex SQL query. It wasn’t playful banter. It was public ridicule. I asked him to speak with me privately. I pressed him on how unacceptable it was for him to publicly mock me. He shrugged and said, “Well, that’s just the way I am. I don’t know what to tell you.”Two weeks later, I put in my notice that I was leaving to join another startup. That clown was naive enough to act shocked and angry that I was leaving. After repeated negative interactions with him that made me feel stupid, I decided it wasn’t worth the bullshit, so I left. Sometimes that’s the right thing to do.As a result, I put “Work for asshole” in the negative red center of my diagram. It’s not what brings out the best in me, nor does it lead to an enjoyable work environment, so I refuse to do it anymore. Your red circle is for experiences that you find are deal-breakers when it comes to your overall well-being. I left quite a bit of money on the table by leaving the company when I did, but I found much more peace and self-confidence on the other side.Part 2: Pick your career progression wiselyNow that you have an understanding of your range of tolerance, and a list of things you can do to stay within your range, consider how your broader life choices will fit into your tolerance target.It begins with a concept I’ll refer to as the “career S-curve.” It’s a measure of how much “stuff” we take on during different stages of our careers.On the y-axis is “labor” from low to high. The x-axis is years (into life or career).Generally speaking, we can break our career down into three stages along the career S-curve. The first stage is setting a foundation in terms of getting your career started. The second phase is the acceleration phase, when we tend to push to climb the ladder. The last phase is the peak phase, when we slow things down and ride the coattails of our prior work. We can also generalize the types of responsibilities at each stage. As time goes on, we evolve from developing skills and doing individual-contributor work to something entirely different. During the acceleration phase, people tend to start managing other people and managing projects of increasing scale and complexity. At the peak phase, it presumes that you’ve climbed high enough to where there isn’t much climbing left to do. At this level, you’re managing entire organizations instead of small groups of people. And although you may still be managing some large projects at this level, a huge portion of what you’re doing is managing problems that keep getting bigger and more frequent the higher you climb.The amount of labor and hours tend to increase as well. There are two types of hours that increase. Let’s call them office hours and mind hours. Office hours are the standard measure of the number of hours you’ll work where there’s a “butt in a seat,” i.e. actual work being done. We tend to work more office hours as our career progresses toward the peak.Mind hours are the number of hours that your mind and nervous system are preoccupied with work because of the stresses of it.What most people in the acceleration phase of their career underestimate is the number of mind hours that are spent working, especially if your goal is to get to an executive level, which is in the deceleration phase (there’s only so high you can go). You may work 50-60 hours a week, but you might have to tack on an additional 10-30 hours of mind work on top of that.The thing about mind hours is that they are the most emotionally taxing. You’re worrying about who to hire and fire, projects going off the rails, a CEO who’s on a rampage, and so on. Nights and weekends, which earlier in your career during the foundation stage were used to recover from office hours, are now spent on mind hours, eliminating most of the room for proper rest and recovery at an intellectual and emotional level.As an overachiever, you’re probably thinking, “Well, of course I’m going to be an executive. That’s what successful people like me do.” Sure, you can do it. But the better question to ask is whether you should.Part 3: Pick your life progression wiselyDetermining if you should keep climbing the ladder is partly answered by understanding what the trade-offs and consequences are. After all, the career choices you make have an impact on other facets of your life.Let’s turn to the S-curve of life, which is a similar model but applied to non-work-related aspects of living. It is also broken into three basic buckets.In childhood, life is full of mystery and exploration, and everything is exciting because it’s new. On a relative stress scale, young life tends to be easier than adulthood. Not always, but often.The acceleration phase is when you’re pushing well into adulthood and midlife experiences. That’s often characterized by major expenses such as cars and homes and is when the precariousness of life becomes more evident when people have accidents, get sick, encounter major hardships, and have to respond to various fire drills (losing a job, kids getting sick, etc.). All of which are taxing on your mind and body.Lastly comes the peak stage of life. We and others begin to decline physically and we prepare to pass on our legacy to, if we’re lucky, our family and friends.When worlds collideIt’s roughly between our late 20s through our 50s when these two S-curves collide. We take on more not only at work but also outside of work. We walk ourselves year by year into overload, especially as overachievers within a culture that encourages achievement as a defining element of a life well-lived. Our ability to take on a lot is thoroughly tested. As high achievers, we’re conditioned to not question if we should take on more. We just put our heads down and run face-first into exhaustion without pausing long enough to ask ourselves, “What am I doing? And why am I still doing it?”Benefits of periods of intolerabilityAll of that said, I’m not arguing that we should avoid any period of intolerability. There may be times when you decide it’s necessary to expose yourself to harsher conditions. But that’s the key—you should consciously decide when and why a wander into the intolerable makes sense.In biology, there is a concept called hormesis. What it refers to is that all organisms have adaptive mechanisms that kick in when the organism is put under a reasonable amount of stress, and those mechanisms are adaptations that may improve the organism’s tolerance or performance. A common example would be exercise when it comes to increasing muscle mass, bone density, and cardiovascular capacity.In a professional context, there are times when it makes sense to seek situations that can produce a “hormetic career response.” There are promotions or new roles that you may seek that require a step up in effort and responsibilities, and you may determine that it’s worth the extra stress and work to pursue it.Intolerability example Let me provide a personal example. Early in my career, I made a decision that I was going to establish financial freedom as quickly as I could. I understood that it meant increasing my earnings from work (via promotions) while keeping my lifestyle costs as low as I could. I would then aggressively invest my savings to build a modest nest egg.Here’s a plot of my actual earnings vs. cost of living per year since the beginning of my career:The first and second green rows are when I took 6+ months off during those years to recharge. I left Quora during year 8 of my career because I was having lots of panic attacks and bouts of depression and struggling with my OCD. And I stepped back from Wealthfront at year 14 of my career due to the heart issues I wrote about above, which were driven by long periods of excess stress.As a result, my earnings were lower those years. The last green row, in year 17, is when I declared that I had enough money saved such that I could live a simple life off my savings and not have to work as hard anymore to build my nest egg.I also kept my annual cost of living low relative to my earnings, especially by the time I was about 10 years into my tech work. I made the decision to not own a home in the Bay Area, keeping me from having to pay for a $1M+ jumbo loan, which would have required more years of work that would regularly push me outside a tolerable range of stress. You’ll also notice that there were three different acceleration phases in my career. Those are the periods when I made a push into new jobs, higher levels, and higher pay. Those periods also coincided with higher stress, leading to major burnout and the need to step back for rest and recovery. My nervous system was totally shot by the end of each period.Going back to the S-curve metaphor I shared earlier, it would be more accurate to say that a career is a series of S-curves stacked on top of each other.As you can see from my personal example, I had three major S-curves. However, I decided to call it quits shortly into my third major S-curve, since the benefits no longer outweighed the costs. In the early stages of my career, I experienced many benefits from the acceleration pushes. I paid off school loans, gained new skills, expanded my network, and increased my earnings. And I moved closer to my ultimate goal of financial independence one year at a time. But by the third push, I could no longer justify the juice being worth the squeeze. So I made another major lifestyle change in 2020, when I moved to a small blue-collar community with a significantly lower cost of living relative to Silicon Valley. With what would have been a down payment on a home in the Bay Area, I was able to purchase my home outright. The same type of home costs four times as much in the Bay Area.That meant I had no mortgage to worry about, which is a major expense that keeps most people locked into doing work that may drive them outside their acceptable range of tolerance. Now, as long as I make at least $35,000 a year post-tax, I won’t have to dip into my savings or investments at all. Note that I also assumed that the equity I held in the startups I worked for would be worth $0. That was a conservative assumption that drove me to keep my cost of living low relative to my earnings. Anything that comes in from stock options will be icing on the cake.So before you make your next major career or life decision, pause and ask yourself a few questions: How much money do I truly need to live the life I envision for myself? What would I have to sacrifice if I reduced my salary by half, and would it be worth it?What would I need from my job in order for it to be worth the extra labor and stress?Saying no to the unnecessaryIn 2020 I began having significant mental health issues again. It was brought about by a combination of excess stress and overwork, and isolation brought on by Covid made the situation worse. Had I decided to continue working at the level I was, I was guaranteed to earn a lot each year—somewhere just short of $1M. If I continued for eight more years, until my 25th year of work, my gross earnings from salary alone would have ballooned. In the below example, I would have earned about $10M in cumulative salary during my entire career, with 70% of my career earnings being in the last eight years.However, since I decided to take a major step back to focus on my health and not continue with the same stressful lifestyle, I am no longer earning nearly that much per year. Yet it was worth it. Within 30 days of making several major lifestyle changes to focus on my health, my level of blood cortisol, a dominant stress hormone, dropped by 30%. And I finally had months of dedicated time to work through the childhood trauma that had been taxing my nervous system for decades.That’s the beauty of knowing when to say “enough is enough.” Given my modest lifestyle goals and my desire to focus on my health, I was able to call it quits with the stress of running high-growth startups and give my nervous system the rest that it desperately needed. And I was able to make a complete investment in the other aspects of my life that had been neglected for years.How to develop more toleranceAlthough there are benefits to windows of intolerance, we should still aim to remain within the range of tolerance as often as possible. To do so, you can widen that window in a couple of ways:Lower your baseline agitationReduce recovery time from peak stressLower your baselineThis means lowering your default state of agitation. I’m more anxious than the average person (I have PTSD and OCD diagnoses), so my range of tolerance is narrower than I’d prefer. To widen it, I try to engage with my green-circle items as much as possible. Hot sauna and hot yoga are mainstay techniques for me. The reason for that is I find them effective at lowering my baseline heart rate without the wear and tear of a traditional workout. Most of the time I’m walking around with what I refer to as “PTSD heart” (it’s rapidly beating from fight-or-flight mode even though everything is OK). With a hot sauna or yoga session, I experience a meaningful decline in my resting heart rate once I’m in the recovery period. It tends to last for a few hours at a time and sometimes for the rest of the day. A 20-year study involving 30,000 people in Japan demonstrated a 28% decline in cardiovascular disease for those who took a sauna every day versus those who didn’t.For me, it’s a green-circle behavior that I stick to religiously for the impact it has on regulating my nervous system. I could say more about it, but biochemist Rhonda Patrick does a better job, so listen to her instead:Reduce recovery timeProfessional fighters know how important it is to recover quickly in between periods of high exertion. A five-minute round pushes most fighters into an intolerable physiological range, so they have to become skilled at recovery in order to approach the next round fresh and ready to fight again. Although I’m using athletes as an example, the concept of recovery from excess stress applies to anyone experiencing a high range of physical and/or psychological stress. Without a serious commitment to recovery, we can’t expect to improve our ability to bounce back from periods of intolerability.The good news is that by drafting your tolerance list and turning it into a tolerance target, you can create a lifestyle that not only manages the frequency with which you’re brought into intolerable periods but also gives you the tools to quickly recover from high-stress periods, which in turn improves your range of tolerance moving forward. Knowing when to stopThere will be times when it makes sense to push very hard on career growth, so long as it aligns with the vision you have for your future and respects the boundaries of your personal range of tolerance. The purpose of life isn’t to sacrifice our well-being. The purpose of life is to flourish. But it requires sacrifices to be made. Maybe you should turn down that promotion. Or not buy that house that will bind you to 5-10 years of additional work to pay for it. It may also require separating ourselves from people whose lifestyle preferences are misaligned with our own. It can be done as long as you understand your own limitations and make conscious life decisions that align with what enables you to flourish. And when the time comes to call it quits, you will feel secure in saying, “No thanks. I’ve had enough.”Thank you, Andy 🙏  For more, subscribe to Andy’s Newsletter and follow him on Twitter.

Each week I tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out about work.SubscribeQ: What are the best PM courses out there?We’re living in a golden age of courses. Courses as far as the eye can see. A great course can change your life (I know many people who’ve had transformational experiences), and a bad course can be a huge time and money suck. So you need to choose wisely. With the end of the year coming and L&D budgets expiring, it’s a great time to lock down a course.Though I haven’t taken many PM courses recently, I did teach a course last year (that I’ve since put on pause to make time for other projects, like the podcast), and through my research prepping for the course, and this great Twitter thread, I feel like I’ve got a pretty good idea of which courses are worth your time. Below, I’m going to go out on a limb and recommend 10 PM courses to check out—five for senior PMs and five for up-and-coming PMs—plus a bunch of honorable mentions if you’re an overachiever.I’m mostly limiting my recommendations to courses that are (1) live, (2) cohort-based, (3) have run a couple of cohorts, and (4) plan to run many more.

Particularly anything actionable. So I decided to do my own digging. I spent the past month personally reaching out to founders, scouring interviews, and tapping the Twitterverse. Below, you’ll find first-hand accounts of how essentially every major consumer app acquired their earliest users, including lessons from Tinder, Uber, Superhuman, TikTok, Product Hunt, Netflix, and many more. Enjoy!My biggest takeaways from this research:Just seven strategies account for every consumer apps’ early growth.Most startups found their early users from just a single strategy. A few like Product Hunt and Pinterest found success using a handful. No one found success from more than three.The most popular strategies involve going to your user directly — online, offline, and through friends. Doing things that don’t scale.To execute on any of these strategies, it’s important to first narrowly define your target user. Andy Johns recently shared some great advice about this.The tactics that you use to get your first 1,000 users are very different from your next 10,000. A topic for a different post.If you have any additional insights, stories, or feedback to share, don’t hesitate to DM me. Otherwise, let’s dive into the strategies.1. Go where your target users are, offlineKey question: Who are your early target users, and where they currently congregating offline?College campuses — Tinder and DoorDashWhitney Wolfe and Justin Mateen would basically run around USC pitching Tinder to sororities and fraternities. The hook of seeing other single people on campus for the first time (and knowing if they’re interested in you) went viral.— Jeff Morris Jr.The very first iteration of DoorDash was a website called paloaltodelivery.com with PDF'd menus of restaurants in Palo Alto. Tony and the team printed a bunch of flyers charging $6 for delivery and put them all over Stanford University. He and the team first wanted to see if there was demand. That was how it all started. A website with PDF menus and flyers.— Micah Moreau Startup offices and transit hubs — Lyft and Uber We asked everyone on our team to give us their list of contacts at startups and we contacted them to ask their permission to come by with a free Bi-Rite ice cream sundae dropoff for their employees. They basically all said yes, because Bi-Rite is delicious. :) So we arranged a dropoff operation and had teams of staff with insulated bags taking ice cream sundae kits to all of the companies and giving them Lyft credits.— Emily Castor WarrenThere was a very significant use of street teams early on at Uber. They went to places like the Caltrain station and handed out referral codes. There are stories about how Travis went to Twitter HQ personally and handed out referral codes.— Andrew ChenMalls — SnapchatEvan started showing it to people one on one, giving tutorials, explaining why it was fun, even downloading the app for them. […]Evan was willing to try anything to get users. When he was home in Pacific Palisades, he would go to the shopping mall and hand out flyers advertising Snapchat. “I would walk up to people and say, ‘Hey would you like to send a disappearing picture?’ and they would say, ‘No,’” Evan later recalled. — How to Turn Down a Billion Dollars, The Snapchat Story by Billy GallagherNeighborhood HOAs — NextdoorBack then, the founding team knew that it would only work if they could find a neighborhood to embrace the idea of a social network for neighborhoods, as well as test it along the way. Choosing the right neighborhood was essential.That neighborhood is known as Lorelei. Nestled close to the Bay on streets shaded by trees, the neighborhood was close-knit and small yet vibrant, with the longest-standing homeowner’s association in the state of California. The community already had some ways to communicate with each other, which was a promising sign. We reached out to board members of the homeowners association, and they were more than willing to hear us out. After an initial conversation, they invited us to present the concept to more residents at their next board meeting.— Sarah LearyCraft fairs — EtsyEtsy decided to actually go into all these fairs across the United States, having people travel to all these craft fairs and recruit sellers because the sellers would eventually recruit their own buyers to the website instead of just using digital marketing.— Thales TeixeiraApple stores — Pinterest We did all kinds of pretty desperate things, honestly. I used to walk by the Apple store on the way home. I’d go in and change all the computers to say Pinterest. Then just kind of stand in the back and be like, “Wow, this Pinterest thing, it’s really blowing up.”— Ben Silbermann(Note: This strategy will obviously be less effective while we shelter-in-place 😷) 2. Go where your target users are, onlineKey question: Who are your early target users, and where they currently congregating online?Hacker News — Dropbox Drew created a simple video, demoing the product, and published it on April 2007 on Hacker News with the title \"My YC app: Dropbox – Throw away your USB drive. That video brought the first users to the emerging Dropbox.— John PopelApp Store — TikTok/Musical.lyThere was a secret in the app store. You could make the application name really really long. And the search engine on the App Store gives more weight to the application name rather than the keybookwords defined. So we put a really long application name, \"make awesome music videos with all kinds of effects for Instagram, Facebook, Messenger”. And then traffic came from the search engine. That's how we initially got started.— Alex ZhuProductHunt — LoomFirst ~3k came in from Product Hunt on launch day + 1-2 days after. 3k-20k: Came from early champions at organizations (we tried to build 1:1 relationships with all of them).21k+: we introduced our referral system ($5 in credits for every coworker you refer up to $50)— Shahed KhanPiggy-back off of an existing online community — Netflix and BufferTo help us connect further with customers, we brought in Corey Bridges to work on customer acquisition – or, more specifically, on something we jokingly called Black ops. A one-time English major at Berkely, he was a brilliant writer with a gift for creating characters. He'd realized, early on, that the only way to find DVD owners was in the fringe communities of the internet: user groups, bulletin boards, web forums, and all of the other digital watering holes where enthusiasts met up. Corey's plan was to infiltrate these communities. He wouldn't announce himself as a Netflix employee. Posing as a home theater enthusiast or cinephile, he would join the conversation in communities geared toward DVD fanatics and movie buffs, befriend the major players, and slowly, over time, alert the most respected commenters, moderators, and website owners about this great new site called Netflix. We were months from launch, but he was planting seeds that would pay off...big time.— That Will Never Work by Marc Randolph (Netflix)Solely through guest blogging we’ve acquired around 100,000 users within the first 9 months of running Buffer. Here is more on this number, a bit before we hit the 100,000. It’s been something that was very gradual though. Within the space of around 9 months, I wrote around 150 guest posts. Of course the early ones barely drove any traffic and only very gradually did things improve, I think that’s very important to understand. It will take a while until you can find the right frequency of posting. — Leo Widrich (Buffer)3. Invite your friendsKey question: Do your friends fit into the target user group? If so, have you invited them yet?YelpInviting people from our network (mostly former coworkers from PayPal) drove our initial users. We asked all our network to invite their friends, and being startup people who wanted to help us, they obliged, so two-degrees out we probably got to 1k or so users. The takeaway is not to underestimate the power of one's personal referral network and to think deeply about the incentive and mechanics.— Russel SimmonsLyftBefore the waitlists came personal email invites to our friends, like the one above.— Emily Castor WarrenFacebookThefacebook.com went up on Wednesday, February 4, 2004. “It was a normal night in the dorm,” Moskovitz recalled. “When Mark finished the site, we told a couple of friends. And then one of them suggested putting it on the Kirkland House online mailing list, which was, like, three hundred people. And, once they did that, several dozen people joined, and then they were telling people at the other houses. By the end of the night, we were, like, actively watching the registration process. Within twenty-four hours, we had somewhere between twelve hundred and fifteen hundred registrants.”— New YorkerQuoraQuora launched in January 2010 with a user base largely composed of D'Angelo's and Cheever's college and high-school friends, meaning there was a lot of early Quora information on the best places to eat in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where Cheever was raised. But they also built a feature into the site whereby users could invite people, and soon their friends from Facebook were summoning people from other startups, and other entrepreneurs.— WiredLinkedInReid intentionally seeded the product with successful friends and connections recognizing that cultivating an aspirational brand was crucial to drive mainstream adoption. (The entire company would have been doomed if there had been massive adoption of have-nots, instead of people who were hiring, recruiting etc.)— Keith RaboisSlackWe begged and cajoled our friends at other companies to try it out and give us feedback. We had maybe six to ten companies to start with that we found this way.The pattern was to share Slack with progressively larger groups. We amplified the feedback we got at each stage by adding more teams.— Stewart ButterfieldPinterestSo we released the app and I did probably what everyone does–emailed all my friends and kind of hoped that it would to take off. And no one really got it, to be totally honest with you. […] But there was a small group of people that were enjoying it. And those folks were not who I think stereotypically you think of when you think about early adopters. They were folks that I grew up with, people that were using it for regular stuff in their life. You know, “What is my house going to look like? What kind of food do I want to eat?” Things like that. — Ben SilbermannSubscribe4. Create FOMO in order to drive word-of-mouthKey questions: Does your product rely on UGC? Consider curating the early community.Is your value-prop incredibly strong? Consider throwing up a waitlist.Is your product innately social? Consider relying on existing users to invite new users.Make it exclusive by curating the early community — Instagram, Pinterest, and Clubhouse It’s been interesting to watch Clubhouse do this via private Testflight:Curation (keeping quality high)Exclusivity (creates FOMO)Quick iteration (no App Store review process)High-quality referrals from initial seed users— Todd GoldbergI think the biggest thing overall was that as we were prototyping and testing [Instagram] we gave it to a few folks who had very large Twitter following. Not necessarily a large following overall, but very large followings within a specific community — specifically, the designer community, the online web design community. We felt that photography and the visual element of what we were doing really resonated with those people. And we gave it to those specific people who a large followings.And because they shared to Twitter, it created this tension, of like “When is this thing launching, when’d do I get to play with it?” and that’s the day when we actually launched, it had that springboard affect.— Kevin Systrom (Instagram)Pinterest started as an invite-only community. The first users were design bloggers Silbermann recruited. He advised these invitees to only extend admission to people they knew with unique ideas and creative minds. The exclusive community grew slowly until 2012 when the site removed the invitation requirement.— EntreprenuerAdd a waitlist - Mailbox, Robinhood, Clubhouse, Superhuman, and PinterestMailbox, the email inbox management app for iPhone that was released in beta this week, currently has around 700,000 users queuing up for access, at the time of this writing […] It’s ostensibly a mechanism to help Mailbox’s servers manage the tremendous demand put upon them by users, though some believe it’s a marketing ploy designed to increase demand.— Darrell EtheringtonIn the first year of Superhuman, as we were primarily building, we threw up a landing page. It was a terrible landing page, a basic Squarespace thing, that took us all of 2 hours to put together. All you could do on this page was throw in your email address. And when you threw in your email address, you got an automatic email from me, with two questions:What do you use for email today?What were your pet peeves about it?— Rahul VohraThe last thing from our minds when we launched Robinhood, the initial website, was that it would blow up overnight, so we were kind of cavalier in the way we approached it. [The website] had a description in very simple language saying, \"Commission-free trading, stop paying up to $10 per trade.\" And then there was a button that let you sign up, and then when you signed up, you put in your email, and you would join this wait list where we would actually show you: There's this many people ahead of you, this many people behind you. […]I remember distinctly it was a Friday night. We had been working on the wait list in preparation for our press launch, which would have been, I think, the following Wednesday or Thursday. Everyone goes home, and I wake up Saturday morning, and I open up Google Analytics, and I see something like 600 concurrents on our site, which nobody knew about at that point. I was just like, \"What's going on? This is not normal. Something must be wrong.\" Right?And I'm looking at the analytics — I see a lot of traffic, or the majority of it, coming from Hacker News. And I open up Hacker News, and I see No. 1: \"Chinese Land Spaceship on the Moon,\" No. 2: \"Google acquires Boston Dynamics, the Robotics Company,\" and No. 3 was: \"Robinhood: Free Stock Trading.\" So, first of all, I was like, \"Oh man, like No. 3 on Hacker News? This is sort of like every engineer's dream in the Valley, right? — Business InsiderNew users must be invited by existing users - SpotifyThe music streaming service went live in October 2008, and it kept its free service invitation only, something that had been in place whilst it was in the final stages of development prior to public launch.The invitation-only element was a vital part of the platform’s rise. Not only did it help manage the growth level of Spotify, but it also helped create a viral element to the service, with users each having 5 invites at first to share with their friends.— TNW5. Leverage influencersKey question: Who are influencers of your target users, and how could you get them to talk about your product?TwitterThis is the day-by-day chart for the initial launch. The first public mention of the service I can find is on Evan William's blog late on July 13th, but you can see that even on the 12th there was a mini-boom in registrations. Then Om Malik's post on the 15th really pushed it over the top, with more than 250 people signing up the next day. What I find fascinating is that there were less than 600 people on the service at that point, so it was a very prescient plug. […]A recurring theme is the power of that initial publicity in driving the early users, and the feeling that it was a way to connect with an interesting group of people. Evan's high-profile and Om's endorsement must have been a big help in building that sort of buzz.— Pete WardenProduct HuntOnce we identified an influencer, Nathan or myself sent a personal email, inviting them to contribute and linking to the PandoDaily or Fast Company articles, to tell our story. A manual process indeed, but an effective way to recruit good contributors and open lines of communication for future feedback. — Ryan HooverInstagramThe founders picked their first users carefully, courting people who would be good photographers—especially designers who had high Twitter follower counts. Those first users would help set the right artistic tone, creating good content for everyone else to look at, in what was essentially the first-ever Instagram influencer campaign, years before that would become a concept. Dorsey became their best salesman. He was initially shocked to find out his investment money was going toward an entirely different app than Burbn. Usually, founders pivoted to a new product as a last-ditch effort to avoid going out of business. But Dorsey loved Instagram, way more than he’d ever loved Burbn.When Instagram launched to the public on October 6, 2010, it immediately went viral thanks to shares from people like Dorsey. It reached number one in camera applications in the Apple app store.— No Filter: The Inside Story of Instagram, by Sarah Frier6. Get pressKey question: What’s a unique, compelling, fresh story you could pitch press?SuperhumanThe best way to do it is to pick one or two events a year where you can insert yourself into the cultural zeitgeist. For us, one such event was when Mailbox was being shut down. It was the perfect narrative, “I’m over here, come look at my company.” […] I currently have one of the most widely read articles on how to survive an acquisition. It was written in response to the Mailbox shutdown. […] That post ended up on Medium, and was syndicated to qz.com. We were able to insert it into the Zeitgeist. That article probably took me three days of doing nothing else, and another day of shopping it around. So four days all in. But those four days bought north of 5,000 signups.— Rahul VohraProduct HuntI wrote guest posts on tech publications (like this article on FastCo) to drive awareness. In the early days, press was effective in driving adoption. The same people that read tech publications like TechCrunch are the same people that might want to visit Product Hunt. Additionally, we forwarded compelling products that launched on Product Hunt to reporters that I knew. I made sure to send products that were relevant to their interests or beat, resulting in several articles mentioning and linking back to Product Hunt. Bonus points: We were helping makers and early stage startups get more visibility— Ryan HooverAirbnbThe event that marked the turning point in the business was the 2008 Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Denver, Colorado. The pair saw an opportunity to capitalize on the quadruple over-attended event that caused a massive shortage in rental housing. Finding hosts to offer up rooms in their houses was actually the easy part. Getting people to rent those rooms proved more difficult.The first counterintuitive strategy was to pitch only the bloggers with the smallest audience possible. […] As ridiculous as it sounds, the coverage by these bottom-feeder press was the social proof that more prominent publications needed to piggyback on the story. Eventually, national news networks, including NBC and CBS, were interviewing the founders of the unknown startup that was housing the biggest political convention in history.The DNC bump was great for business, but it only lasted a week. The founders were desperate for a way to extend the impact of the event. While sitting around their kitchen table one day, still extremely broke, they came up with the idea that would bring Airbnb to profitability: cereal.Both designers who graduated from the prestigious Rhode Island School of Design, the pair created fictitious cereals called “Obama O's, the Cereal of Change,” and “Cap’n McCain's, a Maverick in Every Box.” They designed the box artwork themselves and convinced a student at UC Berkeley to print 500 units of each box on the cheap. The boxes were delivered as flat rectangles that had to be cut and assembled by hand.“I was thinking at the time, that Mark Zuckerberg was never hot gluing anything at Facebook – so maybe this is not a good idea,” recalls Chesky.The founders sent boxes to hundreds of the most well-known tech bloggers, hoping that they would proudly display them on their desks and that they, or their colleagues, would eventually write their story. Shortly thereafter, they started selling the political cereal at $40 per box. The Obama O's sold like hot cakes, so much so that they had to give out Cap’n McCain's for free with each purchase. — PandoSlackThat was essentially our beta release, but we didn't want to call it a beta because then people would think that the service would be flaky or unreliable,” Butterfield says. Instead, with help from an impressive press blitz (based largely on the team's prior experience — i.e. use whatever you've got going for you), they welcomed people to request an invitation to try Slack. On the first day, 8,000 people did just that; and two weeks later, that number had grown to 15,000.The big lesson here: Don't underestimate the power of traditional media when you launch.— Stewart ButterfieldInstagramThey also contacted the press directly rather than using a PR firm, and Kevin notes that this went down very well. A good product, pitched by the passionate creators themselves, and as it happens they secured a load of good coverage for launch. “We were shameless about contacting people who we thought would love the product”, says Kevin. “But it paid off. People actually said to us there’s no point contacting publications such as The New York Times and that we’d be wasting our time. But not only did The New York Times speak to us, they also sent someone to meet with us”. On the day of launch in October 2010, all the press coverage happened at roughly the same time and their servers were hit hard.— TNW7. Build a community pre-launchKey question: Could you build a community now, to leverage later?Product HuntProduct Hunt, a daily leaderboard of new products, began as an email list using Linkydink, a tool for creating collaborative daily email digests. […]Over Thanksgiving break, we designed and built Product Hunt. Meanwhile, we reached out to contributors in the MVP and other respected product people, sharing early mocks and gathering feedback. We weren’t just doing customer development, we were getting them excited and making them feel like part of the product (and they were, helping guide our design decisions).5 days later, we had a very minimal but fully functional product. We emailed our supporters a link to Product Hunt, informing them not to share it publicly. The supporters were thrilled to join and play with a working version of something they had thought about and indirectly, helped build. That day we acquired our first 30 users. […] By the end of the week, we had 100 users and felt ready to share Product Hunt with the world.— Ryan HooverStackOverflowThe founders of Stack Overflow (Joel Spolsky & Jeff Atwood) both had large communities of existing followers from their previous online endeavors (Joel On Software and Coding Horror respectively). They invited members of those communities to participate in a private beta, in which they seeded the site with content so it didn't launch with no content whatsoever.— JonIn summaryTop seven strategies to acquire your first 1,000 usersGo where your target users are, offlineGo where your target users are, onlineInvite your friendsCreate FOMO in order to drive word-of-mouthLeverage influencersGet pressBuild a community pre-launchKey questions to ask yourself to determine where to focus:Who are your early target users, and where they currently congregating, offline?Who are your early target users, and where they currently congregating, online?Do your friends fit into the target user group?

Each week I tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out about work.SubscribeQ: I know that as a PM I need to lead through influence. So how do I get better at influence?First, let’s be real. PMs at most companies actually do have more authority than other functions. Though not explicit, it’s usually there. Nevertheless, leading by authority alone isn’t ever a great idea, and the best product leaders are incredibly good at the art of influence. Just look at any effective leader within your organization—they are almost certainly the best at getting done what they want done.The best way to improve your influence skills is to study people who are really good at it. And imho, one of the greatest influencers of all time is Frodo Baggins. Hear me out.If you’re not familiar with The Lord of the Rings, Frodo is a very unassuming character (he’s like 3 feet tall), without any superpowers of any kind. In spite of that, he was entrusted with the most important mission in the world—to travel across Middle Earth to destroy a very dangerous ring.And he does it (sorry for the spoiler). Not through any real power over anyone but through grit, determination, and … influence.By studying Frodo’s journey, we can learn how to become better influencers ourselves. I present seven ways to improve your influence skills, as taught to us by Frodo Baggins and The Lord of the Rings.Strategy 1. Make their goals your goalsHow did Frodo convince the most badass people in the world to risk their lives and help him get the ring to Mount Doom? By connecting his goals to their goals.Everyone wanted this ring destroyed. Frodo knew that. He made it clear that he was going to risk his life to achieve this KPI. Everyone immediately had a great reason to help him get there.In one real-life example, I was leading the launch of the Superhost program at Airbnb, and I had to convince the search team to be OK with adding a Superhost badge to the listing cards (see top left below).The search team was really skeptical, thinking this new visual badge would pull people to listings that weren’t optimal (e.g. lower-ranked listings). Initially, my pitch was around my team’s goals: increasing host retention and host engagement. But after a bit of back-and-forth, I adjusted my pitch to focus on what I knew the search team cared about most: increasing guest-side conversion. I told them this had a good shot at actually increasing conversion, and that we would run a specific A/B test to find out. They finally agreed, the results ended up being positive, and everyone was happy.“Talk to someone about themselves and they’ll listen for hours.” ―Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence PeopleBefore asking someone to do something for you, take 10 seconds to reflect on what they want. Put yourself in their shoes. What are their motivations? What are their incentives? What’s important to them right now?Then, frame your ask in a way that highlights this. For example, how it will:Help them hit their goalsHelp them move faster down the roadHelp the company move its north-star metricMake customers happierHelp them as individuals (e.g. in their performance reviews)Here’s some additional great advice from Wes Kao:Wes Kao 🏛 @wes_kaoTo increase the chance of getting a yes:\n\n1) Write the ask\n2) Highlight parts that benefit you\n3) Highlight parts that benefit the other person\n\nYou may be surprised how much of your note is self-serving.\n\nThe key is to edit so the final version is ~90% about the other person.4:00 PM ∙ Nov 13, 2021541Likes65RetweetsWes Kao 🏛 @wes_kaoHere’s an actual note I edited for a friend a few years ago.\n\nYellow = about themselves\nGreen = about the recipient\n\nAfter the exercise, they were shocked at the page full of yellow highlights. Their pitch email was entirely about themselves! 4:00 PM ∙ Nov 13, 2021227Likes16RetweetsAsk yourself: How will your ask benefit the other person’s goals?Strategy 2. Charge your trust batteryWhen people trust you, life is easy. When they don’t, not so much.Source: John CutlerMy favorite way to think about trust in the workplace is as a battery—as Tobi Lütke (CEO of Shopify) popularized:“People sort of think about trust as almost an on/off kind of thing. Like, I trust my mother, I don’t trust the NSA. But it’s really a gradient … with a lot of different points on [the] spectrum.” —Tobi LütkeYou can charge your battery by doing things that build trust, and tap into your reserves when you need people to trust you.Some ways to charge your trust battery:Do what you say you willListen. Make the person feel heard.Help people out—create a foundation of reciprocityHelp people reach their personal goalsPoint out the contributions and achievements of othersMake time to talk when you don’t need anythingTake people’s feedback into accountAssume good intentionsWhy did Samwise Gamgee leave everything behind and risk his life to help Frodo? Because Frodo’s trust battery was off the charts. Frodo has helped Sam his whole life. When Frodo needed help, there was so much trust built up that Sam had no doubts that he’d go to the ends of the (Middle) Earth to help him.Ask yourself: What can I do this week to charge my trust battery with influential people?Strategy 3. Help them see what you seeStephen Covey (author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People) teaches, “With people, slow is fast and fast is slow.” Rush people into a quick decision, and they’ll either quickly change their mind or it’ll later likely blow up in your face. Instead, if you take the time to make sure the other person truly sees what you see, and understands why this is the correct (and only) path, they’ll follow you, and stick with you through difficult times.This is how Gandalf influenced Frodo to take on this harrowing mission. He didn’t force Frodo to go. Instead, he sat there for days, explaining to Frodo why the world is in such peril, why he is the only person in the world who can take on this responsibility, and why it needs to happen now.SourceGandalf explained the why, and brought Frodo on his thought journey. When you last ran into an obstacle trying to influence others, did you bring them on your thought journey and help them see what you see, or did you jump straight to the ask?Some ways to help others see what you see:Loop your colleagues in earlySpend time explaining the whyInvite them to kickoffsAsk them to lay out their concrete objections, and address their concernsCommunicate regularly as your thinking evolvesGive people a chance to give inputPaint a compelling vision of what could be“If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.” —Antoine de Saint-Exupéry"},{"title":"Six rules of hiring for growth","article":"👋 Hey, Lenny here! Welcome to the monthly ✨ free edition ✨ of my weekly newsletter. If you’re not a subscriber, here’s what you missed this month:Picking a wedgeBreaking into growthCommunity wisdomSubscribeQ: When is the right time to hire my first full-time growth person? What should I look for when hiring for growth?As Paul Graham teaches us, “Startup = growth. The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.” Thus, your first growth hire is one of the most important hires you’ll make. To tackle your question, I’ve pulled in Elena Verna, one of the smartest growth people I’ve ever met (and who I’ve been trying to convince to write a guest post for nearly a year). Below, Elena generously shares her six hard-won lessons on growth hiring. Over the past 10+ years, Elena has helped hire and build growth teams at companies like Netlify, MongoDB, HP, and Krisp, and previously led growth at Miro, SurveyMonkey, and Malwarebytes. An early draft of this post has already become my go-to reference for helping founders figure out their growth hiring strategy, and I’m excited to share it with you all.You can find Elena on LinkedIn and Twitter.Do you have strong product-market fit and feel ready to ramp up your investment in growth by hiring your first full-time growth person? Unfortunately, some of the first set of decisions that founders make when embarking on this journey are flawed. The most common mistakes they make are:Hiring a growth generalist without understanding what growth means for your companyBuilding a growth team before a data teamPrioritizing Head of Growth as your first growth hireHiring the wrong type of growth profileChasing after external talentPutting growth in the wrong departmentToday I want to offer a step-by-step framework for how to go about building a successful growth team.Rule 1: Growth model before growthGreat products have incredible product-market fit—they have correctly proved a compelling value hypothesis that describes why a customer is likely to use the product. Great companies, on the other hand, have product-market fit coupled with a strong growth model—predictable, sustainable, and defensible strategies that help achieve maximum distribution in the market. Just like a product, your growth model needs to be researched, built, launched, and iterated on. You won’t get it right immediately. I suggest spending time on this during, or shortly after, you’ve found product-market fit, to ensure that your initial traction can be scaled.A growth model is made up of two parts:Growth leversGrowth motionsGrowth levers describe ways to impact your business’s revenue growth by making changes to your customers’ journey. Growth levers answer the following questions:Acquisition: How do you acquire customers?Retention: How do you activate and engage your customers?Monetization: How do you monetize your customers?Every growth lever is leveraged through a growth motion. A growth motion describes which team or tactic is accountable for a successful outcome in the growth lever. There are many fantastic, established growth motions to apply to each growth lever, such as product-led, sales/success-led, marketing-led, support-led, community-led, etc. Let’s explore the first three:1. Product-ledProduct is accountable for the output of the growth lever by engaging customers in product actions.Acquisition example: Miro (collaborative whiteboard platform) customers need to collaborate in the product to receive value, which results in customers acquiring more new customers via invites to colleagues.Retention example: SurveyMonkey (online surveys platform) customers receive notifications that new responses have been collected on an open survey, triggering them to re-engage with the product to analyze results.Monetization example: Netlify (web workflow platform) customers discover a product feature wall for site password protection and convert via self-serve monetization flow to the paid plan to unlock functionality.2. Sales- and success-ledThe sales team engages customers in the actions that will result in the growth lever output.Acquisition example: Sales team discovers potential decision makers through outbound efforts, convincing them to see a demo or start a trial.Retention example: Success team holds quarterly business reviews with the customer to communicate value delivered, to ensure that the customer continues to engage.Monetization example: Sales team nurtures the customer, resulting in contract signing.3. Marketing-ledMarketing engages customers in the actions that will result in the growth lever output.Acquisition example: Marketing team utilizes organic or paid methods across third-party platforms such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter to grab customer attention and convince them to give the product a try.Retention example: Marketing uses an email lifecycle to communicate the value of the product to the customer.Monetization example: Marketing team deploys messaging nurture, retargeting tactics to generate monetization interest from the customer.Now mix and match, layer, and sequence the above motions across the growth levers! You can be marketing-led in acquisition; product- and sales-led in monetization; and product-led in retention; while ideating how to sequence product-led to acquisition. The unique combination, layering, and sequencing of the growth motions localized for your product and deployed against your growth model is what will create a predictable, sustainable, and competitively defensible growth model. So what is your most critical growth lever right now and most likely growth motion to apply against it?Rule 2: Invest in the dataAlthough the final desired output of any business is revenue, the levers that a team pulls to impact revenue sit deep within the user journey of your product. Relying on financial performance as the ultimate guiding principle for decision-making leads to short-term revenue optimization and limited investment in long-term sustainable growth. Understanding customer progression through a data lens will help you identify not only which growth lever you should prioritize, but where you should focus your efforts to yield the biggest short- or long-term impact.Whether you are a marketplace, SaaS, direct-to-consumer, social network, or any other type of business, you can think of your data as a company organizational chart:Revenue is the “CEO” (it’s an outcome metric).Acquisition, retention, and monetization are part of the “leadership team,” strategizing how to make the company successful.Activation, engagement, conversion, etc. are the key “team members” that work tirelessly to deliver on outcomes for the company—these are the metrics your growth team will drive and impact.“Chief of staff” is your North Star metric, which keeps close tabs on the “CEO,” working behind the scenes as a predictor to revenue success. Building a company’s data organization will allow you to:Understand where the most customer friction happens, and prioritize opportunities for growth.Help your first growth team members hit the ground running, and be empowered with data insights to have a greater chance of delivering the biggest impact.Aid in the creation of growth teams or growth pods around acquisition, retention, and monetization.It may take many years to develop a comprehensive company data org, but once you do, you will be data-driven. Focus on the “leadership team” first, which will get you to a data-informed stage. Starting to identify team members will transition you to data-driven territory. See more on data efficacy stages in this blog post, and a guide to helping you find your North Star metric.Rule 3: Create the first growth model yourselfThis is where you do not hire the Head of Growth. It is up to the core leadership team to figure out the first version of your growth model—the primary levers and motions that you believe will drive your business growth. Only you know all the nuances of the market, product, and customer, hence are best positioned to put together the first version of a growth model that will have the highest likelihood of success.Your growth model, just like product-market fit, is part of the core foundation of your company. Product, marketing, and growth leaders can help you evolve and scale initial traction, evolving your business for long-term success. But doing the first growth-model exercise with the founding team will help you create an authentic growth model that closely leverages your product-market fit strengths and takes advantage of the market opportunities. In fact, companies leverage their growth models to win against direct competitors. Two examples:SurveyMonkey hit product-market fit in the early 2000s by creating a software solution that enabled a much easier way for customers to collect feedback. It won a prosumer market with the product-led acquisition approach of the survey creators distributing SurveyMonkey-branded surveys to the respondents via casual contact loop, monetizing prosumers via product-led self-serve channels.Qualtrics, a direct competitor, was able to enter the online survey market by applying a sales-led acquisition motion, targeting educational institutions first. With students gradually entering the workforce and becoming decision makers, it switched its acquisition motion heavily toward enterprise buyers, getting great traction with sales-led monetization inside companies. Nearly the same product was able to enter and succeed by applying a unique growth model against its product.So why is it a bad idea to outsource the first growth-model creation exercise to the Head of Growth?Tasking a new Head of Growth hire with the creation of the growth model will likely result in a copy-paste solution from their past. It takes many months, if not years, to understand the true DNA of the product and market, which should guide growth model selection. You will either lose precious time on the market by waiting or rush and end up with a model that will have a high likelihood of failure. The goal of a great growth team is to accelerate organic trends—to make it easier for people to do things they already want to do. Your existing team is best equipped to understand all the things people already want to do related to your product.Switching a company’s mindset from building great products (product-market fit) to growing a fantastic business (growth model) is an evolution that every business has to embark on during its scaling journey. Tasking a new Head of Growth on the leadership team with achieving this mindset shift may result in internal resistance to change. Evolving the mindset with the founding team is the key to setting a company up for success not only with growth but with any newly formed department. It is important to understand that the initial growth model is a hypothesis with assumptions that are yet to be proven. Your team’s first order of business will be to learn about the validity of the assumptions. Here’s a sample template for what a growth model could look like: Rule 4: Hire a builderIn growth, there exist three types of profiles:Innovators: Enjoy thinking big. They love ideating about new loops, channels, and tactics and pressure-testing existing hypotheses. Most often they hold VP-level roles in Growth and will be best deployed to evolve your growth model.Builders: Generalists who will help you build out your existing growth model hypotheses by creating systems, processes, and learnings. Most often they hold Growth PM, Growth Marketing, and Lifecycle Manager titles.Optimizers: Hold deep functional knowledge and will allow you to capture every last bit of the improvements out of any given channel, tactic, or loop. These are SEO specialists, Adwords specialists, and CRO titles.In almost all cases, you want to start by hiring a Builder, to prove your model’s validity. If most of your assumptions were right and you are enjoying early traction, you should move to Optimizers next to capture most of the value, finishing with Innovators to begin iterating on the model.If your growth model hypothesis was wrong and you are not seeing the expected impact, then move to Innovators next, who will help you evolve the model based on existing learnings from failures, going after Optimizers only after traction with the growth model has been established.Rule 5: Prioritize homegrown talentAs tempting as it is to open a new role for growth and hire from the outside, it is often the quickest way to fail in growth efforts. Reasons include:The growth function has been around for only a decade, generally speaking—there are not enough people out there who have “been there, done that.” Especially if you are looking for a Head of Growth, you will likely search for a good portion of the year, losing precious time on the market.If somebody has been there and done that, it is not likely they will want to do it all over again and again. I’m sure you’ve heard: “not open to full-time, but advising is an option.”Strong growth leaders are extremely expensive due to scarcity of supply.Growth leaders need internal support. Many of the best ones will run fast-paced and sometimes controversial experiments to help you prove out and evolve your growth model. It’s a good idea to find a growth leader who is hard for your team to stay mad at. Sometimes the best option already works on your team.Growth is about evolution, not revolution. Almost nobody starts their career in growth. Most successful growth leaders came from other departments. A few examples:Data analytics: Casey Winters (ex-growth at Pinterest, CPO at Eventbrite), Elena Verna (ex-growth at SurveyMonkey), Crystal Widjaja (ex-growth at Gojek, CPO at Kumu)Engineer: Lenny Rachitsky (ex-growth at Airbnb), Matt Greenberg (ex-growth at Credit Karma, CTO at Reforge)Marketing manager: Adam Fishman (ex-growth at Lyft, Patreon), Adam Grenier (ex-growth at Uber, growth at MasterClass)Product manager: Bangaly Kaba (ex-growth at Instagram, growth at Popshop Live), Naomi Ionita (ex-product/growth at Evernote and Invoice2go, partner at Menlo Ventures), Nick Soman (ex-growth at Gusto, CEO at Decent)Among the unifying qualities across all of these growth leaders are their natural powers to:Connect actions to outcomesBe data-drivenHave a growth mindsetRespect for scientific methodHunger for learningSo who are the people within the analytics, product, marketing, engineering, or even financial planning and analysis team to take on the first builder/innovator roles?Rule 6: Let your growth model dictate growth org placementShould the growth team be in marketing? Product? Sales? Community? Support? Although each organization and their leaders are unique and hence there is no universal right answer, your growth model should help inform the decision process.Step 1: Start by prioritizing the growth lever you need to drive the most improvement for:Acquisition: My new user growth is 50%, but I believe I should be at hypergrowth of 75% due to current market demand and saturation.Retention: Less than 10% of my customers reach the aha moment, which prevents my loops from working, and I need it to be 30%.Monetization: My free-to-paid conversion is 2%, while the industry average is 5%.Most companies start with acquisition or retention (specifically onboarding), followed by monetization.Step 2: Next, your growth model should indicate what growth motion you either need to build out, optimize, or introduce: marketing-led, product-led, sales-led, etc. For example, to build on the acquisition lever mentioned in Step 1:We will accelerate acquisition from 50% to 75% by capturing SEO and kicking off paid marketing on Twitter: Marketing-led motion Hire a growth marketer under marketingWe will accelerate acquisition by introducing user referral loops and increasing collaborative feature adoption in the product: Product-led motionHire a growth PM under productWe will accelerate acquisition by hiring BDRs and increasing our outbound efforts: Sales-led motionAvoid hiring a growth marketer to solve your product-led motion. In addition to lacking the background to create the most value, they will spend much of their time spinning wheels outside their function in meetings with the product team because of the changes that person’s motions will require to the product.Lastly, companies often wonder whether they should embed growth within an existing team or create a stand-alone function. Most companies end up going through cycles of centralization and functional distribution of the growth teams because both models have their strengths and weaknesses.Embedded teamsPros: Cleaner org design; feels like evolution; easier propagation of learnings; growth mindset throughout the org.Con: Hard time maintaining growth focus, often working on core product or marketing projects and failing to drive a change in the ecosystem. This is often a silent killer.Stand-alone teamsPro: Full autonomy in decision-making.Cons: Feels like revolution; tend to absorb so much outcome accountability on their shoulders that the rest of the organization feels a lack of responsibility to deliver on growth goals for the business.I would recommend always starting with the embedded model, to ensure that growth is an evolution and not a revolution, while frequently re-evaluating organizational design. Growth models and growth teams are just as important to a successful business as strong product-market fit. There are many incredible products that you’ve never even heard about because they have not invested in their growth model and end up slowly dying. Conversely, there are a lot of terrible products with such strong growth models that they make a company incredibly successful. In any case, I hope you use the tools I’ve described here to create a great growth team and build a successful company!📚 Helpful additional resources20VC podcast episode on the biggest mistakes you can make when hiring for growth Crystal Widjaja blog post on the journey to scale dataAndrew Chen’s blog post on hiring for a Head of GrowthReforge’s Growth Series courseThanks, Elena!

Now, on to this week’s post…Q: How should I structure my PM interview process?I can understand why so many people are befuddled by interviewing product managers—the role is so endlessly undefined, how can non-PMs possibly know what to interview for? As Gergely Orosz (ex-Uber, Microsoft, Skype engineer) confessed in a tweet, “we EMs have no clue how to do these. At first, you wing it; by the third time, everyone has their own, completely different setup.”In my chat with Harry Stebbings last week, I shared a bit of advice on this, but it was quite brief. So let’s get much deeper. Below, I’ll share suggestions for:Structuring your PM interview processWhat specific skills to test forMy favorite interview questionsHow to structure an interview project (plus a bunch of real-life examples)Tips to get them to take your offerDisclaimer: People have strong opinions about how to interview, but very few people have enough data (or have looked at their data) to know if their interview assumptions are actually predictive of performance. Interview best practices are generally anecdotal, so definitely do your own research.With that, let’s get into it.How to structure your PM interview processHigh-level, I’d set up your interview process like so:Recruiter phone screen [30 minutes, optional]: Make sure the candidate meets the minimum requirements for the role and is likely to be a fit for the organization. Focus on their expectations for the role, basic skill questions, personality fit (e.g. not an asshole), and their interview timelines. About 50% of candidates should make it through this step.Hiring manager phone screen [30 minutes]: Make sure there is a strong chance that the candidate is a fit for the role. Focus on getting to know the person as a human, the role, and a couple skills or attributes that you believe to be most important to this role (more on this below). About 40% to 50% of candidates should make it through this step.A full-day interview [4-5 hours]: The day is made up of two parts:A project (done at home before arriving, in the office, or live), sharing what they came up with, with a group of potential colleaguesThree to six 1:1 interviews with potential colleagues, each testing for a key PM skillPost-interview panel discussion [30-60 minutes]: Each interviewer blind votes Strong No, No, Yes, or Strong Yes. Share your vote, discuss, and then the hiring manager makes a decision.Reference checks: Ping their references (and backchannel) to make sure you aren’t missing anything.Make an offer: Put together a compelling offer, share it with them, and try like hell to get them to accept.To benchmark a typical hiring funnel, I asked Benji Encz, CEO of the recruiting platform Ashby, to share stats he had on conversion rates at each step, and wow, did he deliver. Here are hot-off-the-presses stats his team pulled for me, based on over 75,000 recent applications across high-growth tech companies. Takeaway: You need to talk to an average of 23 PM candidates to hire one great one.“Many early-stage teams underestimate how many candidates they need to speak to to make one hire. In our data we also saw that only 13% of inbound applicants even make it to the first screen. You will either need a lot of inbound, or more likely, you will have to fill the funnel with sourced candidates and referrals.”—Benji Encz, CEO of AshbyI would be remiss if I didn’t plug my new Talent Collective here, which is quickly becoming the single best place to find and hire product managers—and help you find your next dream gig.

Walk me through it from beginning to end. I’ll ask questions along the way. [Give this ~7-10 minutes]Strategy: Pick a product you worked on in the past year—talk me through your strategy for it.Customer insights: Tell me about a time you did user research on a product/feature and that research had a big impact on the product.Impact: What’s the most important or impactful product you shipped? What made it so important or impactful? Would it have been as impactful without you, and why?Product sense: How would you improve feature x in our product?This full post includes what to look for in the answers, red flags, and a ton more great interview questions to inspire you. Seriously, go check it out. And don’t forget to keep your questions consistent, with predefined good and bad answers, to avoid bias.“Companies should rely on a structured interview that standardizes the process among candidates, eliminating much subjectivity. These interviews pose the same set of questions in the same order to all candidates, allowing clearer comparisons between them.” —Iris Bohnet, Harvard Business ReviewThe projectI’ve found the project portion of the PM interview process to be the most informative component of the interview. It’s the only time you’ll get to see the candidate tackle a chunky new problem, be able to watch them in action, and have a discussion about it. Though some people don’t include it, I couldn’t imagine a PM interview without it. “Years later I can see that the performance on the project was closely related to their success at Slack over the course of years.”—Merci Grace, former Head of Growth at SlackThe goal of the project is to get a taste of how a candidate approaches a new problem. Most importantly, you aren’t looking at how close they got to the right answer. Instead, you are looking at how they break down the problem, how they structure their solution, and how they communicate it to you. Often the discussion afterward is even more valuable than the prompt itself.You have two options for delivering the project:Before the interview: Give them a project before the full-day interview, to work on at home in some timeboxed amount of time. They then share what they came up with when they come in (or Zoom in) for the full-day interview.The day of the interview: Give them a project at the beginning of the interview day, with a timeboxed amount of time for them to work on it (e.g. 90 minutes). Once they are done, they share what they’ve come up with."},{"title":"The 10 commandments of salary negotiation","article":"👋 Hey, Lenny here! Welcome to a ✨ bonus edition ✨ of my weekly newsletter. Each week I humbly tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out about work.If you’re not a paid subscriber, here’s what you missed this month:GTM motions of 30 B2B SaaS companiesGetting more technicalExamples and templates of 1-Pagers and PRDsSubscribeOn to this week’s post…Q: I’m about to start interviewing for a new job, and I’m really bad at negotiating. I know I should, but I basically never negotiate my comp. How do I learn to negotiate, without pissing anyone off?If you think you’re bad at negotiating, I’m even worse, I promise you. Why can’t you just tell me how much it’ll be, and then we can move on? Why do we need to play this game?? Jeez louise.Well, the reason we have to play this game is because, like it or not, everyone else is playing it. And you’re probably losing — on salary, equity, and promotions. The good news is that because the other side is playing, they expect you to play along (especially at larger companies). So it rarely creates hard feelings when you negotiate. But you have to know how. And that’s where today’s post comes in.Since I’m so bad at this, I pulled in Niya Dragova, co-founder of Candor, to answer your question and to share her hard-earned negotiating wisdom with us. Niya has single-handedly helped hundreds of people negotiate their compensation at all of the top tech companies and, as you’ll see below, has incredible insights into the process. I can honestly say this is the most useful post I’ve ever come across on the topic, and I’m really excited to share it with you all. Enjoy!You can find Niya on LinkedIn and Twitter, you can learn more about Candor here, and don’t miss Niya’s insightful weekly newsletter that highlights hiring trends across the largest tech companies.The 10 commandments of salary negotiationby Niya DragovaThe largest salary increase I’ve helped get was for a female FAANG executive: I helped her get $5.4M more on her offer. Through the process, it struck me that even though she was a senior leader everyone admired (you’d 100% know of her if I told you her name), she had very little knowledge of how to negotiate. Don’t get me wrong — she knew how to ask and be assertive, but she was much less comfortable “playing the game.”And she’s not alone.Regardless of how senior or junior you are, most tech folks struggle with negotiation. Partially this is because compensation is set up to be intentionally misleading. Partially it’s because sticking up for yourself is nerve-racking AF. Here are the 10 commandments to negotiation I wish everyone knew: 1. Negotiation starts earlier than you thinkEvery recruiter worth their salt will ask about your salary expectations when you first start interviewing. Do not — I repeat, do not — give them a number.What to do instead: Ask for the range they’re budgeted for the role.How to say it: “Can you tell me the salary band for this level? Happy to let you know if it’s within my range, and we can discuss specific numbers later when I’ve met the team.”Bonus points: If you’re junior/mid, time all your interviews so you get offers around the same time. If you’re senior, get some press before you start meeting folks.2. Mine for intel during interviewsGo into the interview ready not just to answer questions but to ask some of your own. You will use this as ammunition to negotiate later. Here are a few examples of what you should ask:What’s the biggest priority for the team right now?Why is this role open?What’s the biggest challenge for someone stepping into this role?How does the org structure on the team work?3. Don’t give in to the pressureOnce you’ve been offered the role, the recruiter’s job shifts from evaluating you to closing you. Most experienced recruiters will ask you again to put up a number for your salary. Clever recruiters may even tell you that they “will go to bat for you.” Yeah, no thanks.What recruiters say: “If you give me your number, I will make it happen for you.”What they mean: “I’ll get you something lower, but kinda close to what you asked for.”[Editors note: Some recruiters do indeed go to bat for you, and genuinely want to help you get what you want. Just don’t assume they all do.]4. At FAANG, your recruiter may have no say at allAt FAANG-size companies (i.e. over 5K employees), compensation is heavily formulaic. In fact, there is often a separate team — the “compensation committee” — who sets your salary. They take into account your background, interview performance, and level. They give the recruiter a number to go with. The recruiter then gives you the number, and every time you negotiate they have to go back to that committee to ask for a re-evaluation.What do clever recruiters do? They get your number up-front to save some legwork.Unfortunately, this may hurt your chances of getting more on your offer later. It also deprives you of some valuable data — where you fall in the level/salary band. If you get caught in this loop, quickly turn the tables: most companies will consider “new information,” like another offer, to reopen a negotiation. Don’t forget, an offer to stay from your existing company also counts!5. Read between the linesYour initial offer speaks volumes, if you know how to interpret the data. Here are a few scenarios you should consider:Let’s say you’re applying for an L6 role at a big company. Initial offer comes in low: The team may have felt that you have a lot of “room for growth.” In this case, my advice is to dig deeper and ask the interviewer to share feedback from folks who met you to fix any misconceptions before you ever negotiate. Telling someone you want more money because you’re “the greatest PM ever” while the team felt you were “meh” is not going to fly.Middle of the road: You got “the number” (the medium opening number that’s basically a template recruiters use). It’s the most common opening offer — companies do this to reduce risk of lawsuits. Over 80% of people get it. It likely means you don’t have a strong advocate on the interview loop. Do not negotiate until you match with a team and you have a manager batting for you. Initial offer comes in top-of-band: There was likely a discussion about giving you a higher level. Many times in this case, you can push for an “out-of-band” offer — essentially getting paid for an L7 while you’re an L6.6. At a startup, the playbook is different You may be dealing with the founder directly. It’s very likely there is no range for the role, as smaller companies have much less access to salary data. The goal at the initial offer conversation is to understand three things:The current state of the company (financing, runway, profitability)The plan for your role/functionThe value of the equity, considering exit scenariosThat last one can be tricky because you need data the recruiter may be reluctant to give — the option strike price, preferred price, number of outstanding shares — and you need to understand how options work. At last, get ready to ask:“What is the valuation based on?”And get ready to not get a straight answer until you’ve asked five times (yes, this is normal). TL;DR: Ask the questions an investor would ask because, *news flash*, you are now an investor — but instead of cash, you’re staking your time and earning trajectory on the company’s success. You can meet with the investors too; it’s 100% OK to ask for that when the company is early-stage.Lastly, 2021 has been a weird year for startup compensation, so much of the data from previous years is unreliable. Remote work, abundant access to capital, and greater trust in international talent have skewed things quite a bit. Still, I find the Holloway Guide ranges to be a good starting point.7. Your job is to win hearts and mindsIt can be tempting to think you need to negotiate now that you have data. Nope, not yet. The next step, instead, is to upsell your worth before you come back with any kind of counteroffer. This is especially important if you’re going for a senior role.What to do next: Ask for follow-up meetings with decision makers. If you’re a Director or higher, you can usually ask to meet with any VP and possibly C-level execs. VPs can often meet with the CEO and even board members. Take your time; this is important if you want your salary to reflect your value. If everyone wants you, you’ll be calling the shots later.How to run these effectively: Come prepared with three things, tailored to who you’re meeting: Questions about how you can create meaningful impactIdeas based on your interviews so farBonus points: discussing obstacles to your taking the role and making them sell you on it8. OK, now get some good dataDid you know that women make only 47 cents in equity for every dollar a man makes? A HUGE reason for that is that many women don’t fully evaluate their offer before negotiating. Let’s change that. Particularly if you are a woman, ask yourself these questions: Is the offer competitive? (Browse 5.3M offers here.) How does it work? (When do I vest; what is the stock worth?)Is it all true? (Is the value of the equity over-inflated?)Does it add up? (Consider taxes on bonuses and stock.)If you have goaled comp, are the goals realistic?9. Comparing offersNot all offers are made equal — in fact, they are intentionally confusing. At Google, you may get a front-loaded vesting schedule on your stock; at Amazon, sizable cash bonuses the first two years. It seems obvious that you should look at the comp, but that’s not everything:Which company has a better trajectory?How do promotions work?Is your manager influential enough to pull for you when needed?Is your product or team visible enough to get good resourcing?What’s the company brand worth to your earnings trajectory?TL;DR: Getting paid more up-front doesn’t always mean you’ll make the most overall. Plan carefully.10. Time to make an askIt can be awkward to ask for more money, but trust me, everyone expects you to do it. On top of that, it doesn’t help that so much of the advice out there is conflicting. Let’s set the record straight:“I need a competing offer.”MYTH: You absolutely do not need multiple offers. Just being able to say you’re speaking to other companies is sufficient — you can quote the expected salaries for other roles if needed.“I need to provide copies of my other offers.”MYTH: Nope, nope, nope (even though Google in particular loves to ask for them). You signed an NDA before every interview, so you can always use that as a reason.“I should send the recruiter an email with my ask and justification.”MYTH: Negotiating via email = MAJOR CRINGE and definitely a worse outcome. I know there are folks selling fill-in-the-blank templates out there. My advice if you want a meaningful/large increase is to have the conversation over the phone. “If I find a number online, I can quote it as a reason to get more.”MYTH: Nothing boils a recruiter’s blood more than “It says X on Glassdoor.” Compensation is an exact science — have arguments prepared that are specific to your situation.“The best way to get more is to reiterate how qualified I am.”MYTH: You already got interviewed and everyone’s read your resume. That’s how you got your initial offer; now you need to build additional arguments. Use the information you collected during the interview about what challenges the team is facing — maybe that increases the scope of the role? Discuss why leaving your current role will be hard — are you critical to your current team? In other words: instead of asking for money, make them give you more money by bringing in obstacles the recruiter needs to overcome to close you. “I need to be aggressive and threaten to walk if they don’t match.”MYTH: LOL, let me know how that goes for you. My guess is you’ll get a mediocre increase worded as a “final offer.” If you want big moves, I’m talking $100K+ more, you need to collaborate with your recruiter, not make them an enemy.As a final word of wisdom: Start with negotiating your overall compensation, not individual components. For example, ask for “500K” and then the next round ask “Can I have X more equity?” Then, when you’ve exhausted all other avenues, ask for a signing bonus. If you still need more help, you can always read our guide.  Now that you’ve got all these RSUs in your compensation…If your new RSUs are more than 10% of your liquid net worth, you should make a plan to diversify ASAP. Holding a concentrated position can translate into greater portfolio volatility, which has been shown to reduce compounded growth rates and future wealth. At Candor we help you automate RSU diversification by converting your stock weekly, even during blackout periods. You can find us here.Thanks, Niya!

Fortunately, Substack just started offering a perk called Savvy—a monthly stipend alongside a neat tool that gave me easy access to health insurance plans. Suril was the co-founder and CEO at Savvy, which in the early days meant he was my insurance advisor, enrollment specialist, and customer support—basically my personal health insurance guru. He went on to scale Savvy to tens of millions of dollars in payment volume, and earlier this year, Savvy was acquired by the leading incumbent in the market. When I caught up with Suril, he shared his startup story with me, and I found it incredibly powerful and insightful. I asked if I could share it with my newsletter audience, and I’m excited to do so below.Suril was previously the youngest-ever hire on TPG’s investment team, which led early rounds in Uber, Airbnb, Spotify, Box, and GreenSky. He’s currently advising startups on go-to-market while exploring new ideas in climate and fintech. You can connect with him on LinkedIn or Twitter.Savvy was the first fintech platform of its kind, offering employees payment cards to buy their own health insurance. We took Savvy from 0 to 1, growing to tens of millions in payment volume across thousands of users, but sold before scaling from 1 to 100. Backed by VCs like Y Combinator and Marc Andreessen, we grew the company to a 15-person team and built the market’s first payment card technology. After three years of building, the company was acquired in June by Take Command, the leading incumbent in the health insurance HRA (“health reimbursement arrangement,” employer-funded health benefit plan) space. While our exit was not a Figma-level home run, it felt like a single to right field and the best path forward for the company.Over the years that we built Savvy, many founders, including from the YC community, would reach out seeking advice. While I always made time for these calls, I often left feeling that I’d shortchanged my peers. There were still so many problems facing our nascent startup, how could I possibly have strong perspectives about another company’s challenges? Now that Savvy has been acquired and I’ve left the day-to-day behind, I’ve taken some time to reflect on our journey and what I wish I had known along the way. Below are the biggest lessons.1. Don’t found a startup. Find a problem.There’s a plethora of writing on how to identify and evaluate good startup ideas—we followed none of these.In San Francisco in my 20s, I was in the echo chamber of Silicon Valley looking in. I had been an investor and board observer of unicorn founders and an early employee at a hypergrowth startup. This, I thought at the time, suggested that my pattern recognition was strong and, not one to sit on the bench, I was ready to build a startup.The inspiration for Savvy came after months of research with my friend Kevin Cox on how to fix U.S. health care’s antiquated payments system. These early weeks were a slog. Fresh off quitting our jobs, we toiled from an uncomfortable dining room table, hungry to find a problem to pursue. One day while driving across SoMa, we noticed a billboard stating that the biggest industry conference in health insurance would be taking place in SF the following week. A fortuitous billboard led to us crashing a major health insurance conferenceWe were giddy—we immediately scoured LinkedIn to find a way in. After many dead ends, we found our mule in a health insurance sales rep named Ari. He was energized by our hustle and invited us to shadow every meeting he had lined up at the conference. His ask in return? A couch to crash on; hotels were priced through the roof. We had ourselves a deal.The early days: a makeshift office and plenty of coffee to power through the idea mazeAri shepherded us like Moses across the conference floor, stopping seemingly every 10 meters to greet an acquaintance. For us, seeing the underbelly of the industry was eye-opening and largely monochromatic—the majority of folks were 55-year-old white men in wool blazers. The “technologists” in booths were demoing what looked like my middle-school online learning software. But just a handful of chats gave us more perspective than months of online research. What’s more, we left feeling energized to grab this aging industry by its horns.After the conference, we spent countless more caffeine-fueled hours researching the payments companies we had met. One observation was consistent: the products in the space were “old-school.” We could build a modern software offering, but what specifically to build?We ultimately landed on the debit cards that accompany employer health plans for out-of-pocket spending. When personally using these FSA and HSA debit cards in the past, we had experienced a high-friction process that required uploading receipts on 1990s interfaces. Paired with the fact that employers are the primary payers in U.S. health care, we had conviction that we’d found the right “wedge” into modernizing health-care payments.The v1 Savvy investor memo—“The Future is Savvy”Without speaking to a single user, we developed a vision (and written memo) for an alternative future in health-care payments. Visions without defining a problem are dangerous. They are often solutions to made-up problems or, even worse, alternative realities to things that are working just fine.Looking back, the lesson is clear. Good startup ideas are not about pattern recognition, modernizing, or finding wedges—they are about solving a specific problem.In the weeks that followed, we brought our vision to prospective customers to validate the market need. At first, we received excitement and validation. However, we realized our first several “interviews” were actually sales pitches (e.g. “here’s this cool new thing, what do you think?”). Far too biased to get any real signal. After reading up on customer interview best practices, we tried again, this time with an unbiased script. Not one person brought up health debit cards as a problem they needed to solve. We concluded that our vision, which we had spent many painstaking hours developing, was off the mark. Back to the drawing board—or in our case, the dining table!2. VC funding is my drugSource: DALL-EVC funding is a powerful drug. You sell your vision to people with money, people who shower you with praise, people with huge Twitter followings, people who write blog posts about your greatness and once-in-a-generation ability. You feel amazing.However, the high fades and is accompanied by amplified lows. Most people don’t talk about the pressure, the late-night investor calls, the rising expectations, the compressed timelines, the recurring fundraising circuit, and the constant external signaling.My inbox in April 2020—24/7 speaking with VCsIf there were a Surgeon General warning on this drug, it might read, “Beware. VC funding may lead to dependence and complication. Some users have reported extreme anxiety, loss of control, and nightmares of being on a never-ending treadmill.”Don’t get me wrong—venture capital can supercharge your company’s growth. And it’s often said that it’s easier to raise early, on the promise of traction, without real data to scrutinize. If you take this road, know that your company is a ticking time bomb and managing cash burn is your only defense. There will be no shortage of external pressures to spend more now and raise more later.In March 2020, our decision to raise a seed round was influenced by being in YC. It’s just what YC startups do. The mantra was if you can raise at Demo Day, you should raise. We proceeded to line up six investor meetings per day for the next two weeks. But then came the tectonic shift. News of a deadly virus spreading globally sent the markets pummeling. We’d wake up to 3% to 4% drops in the S&P daily. We shifted all our meetings to Zoom, but investors were clearly distracted—risky seed checks were not the priority over their portfolio companies in chaos. The venture market appeared to dry up that Covid spring.For us, it became a game—if select YC peers were closing rounds, why not us? We just needed to dig our heels in and grind, we thought at the time. Days later, San Francisco instituted shelter-in-place. My co-founder and I fled to Tahoe so we could escape lockdown and pitch from the same room. One week turned into six, but we still hadn’t found a lead investor. Our pitch that health care was on the crest of massive change and that Savvy would be first-to-market was fine, but VCs wanted to know how the business would fare in a pandemic.It was an impossible question—no one had any idea what the pandemic would look like, let alone how any single business would perform. But we crafted a narrative: the pandemic would be an accelerant, of course! After three months of daily investor pitches from our Tahoe hideout, we closed a $2.5 million round. We were relieved, but mostly excited to go back to building and get the hell out of our cabin!Looking back, I question why we raised when we did. We didn’t have nearly enough conviction in the business ourselves. While we had a great story for investors, our metrics weren’t compelling, with only a handful of beta customers with whom we hadn’t yet spent any time. We allowed Demo Day FOMO and fear of a market crash to drive our timing.Why is a preemptive raise bad? For one, it’ll take longer to convince enough investors to close your round. What’s more is that by pitching investors on a vision, perhaps without realizing it you’re committing to a set path for the company. Despite a pandemic-altered landscape, we didn’t course-correct from our vision, telling ourselves “if investors backed us, we must be on the right path.” This vote of confidence from investors ultimately delayed us from seeing the truth—the market had shifted and we needed to pivot.Not too long after our fund-raise, investors began asking us, “When is Savvy going to raise a Series A?” and “Why aren’t you hiring faster?” They would point to peer startups with ballooning headcount on LinkedIn. Some were even raising more capital just months after their last round. We had to constantly remind ourselves to ignore these extrinsic signals. As founders, we were the only people in the trenches digging for signs of product-market fit. Finding PMF should be the only input driving the decision to increase cash burn.David Hsu, the founder of the low-code unicorn Retool, shared with me that he kept Retool’s team to only the co-founders for a full year after his seed fund-raise. His logic? A nimble team can pivot quickly until achieving PMF. What’s most important in the early days is that you spend slowly until you find traction and have reason to pour gasoline on sales and product.One final cautionary tale. In the early days, our friends and investors would often congratulate us on each new hire. Absent other signs of traction, growing the team seemed impressive from the outside. Accepting these accolades was a mistake. Headcount is a cost center that requires precious time to grow and manage.1 The only metric that merits congratulations is product traction/PMF. Fight the urge to use vanity metrics (like team size or news mentions) as a sign of progress.3. In public we trustThere’s something sexy about the title “founder of stealth startup” on LinkedIn. It’s mysterious and entices visitors to go deeper into your profile. You’re part of a secret club of 9,000 other stealthy builders.Allure aside, I’ve since learned that building in stealth is always a mistake. I’ve been part of a stealthy but now successful AI startup, and I’ve observed several stealthy founding teams. One observation was consistent: stealthiness inhibits frequent market signal and greatly increases time to PMF. Any perceived gains of building an advantage over competitors by being stealthy are lost when you inevitably take longer to achieve PMF. For companies building new markets, like Savvy, competitors may even be valuable in evangelizing the new market. If a rising tide lifts all boats, you want the tide to rise faster!I’d take a completely opposite tack—be a public startup. As the VC Bill Gurley said to us, you should “shout from every rooftop, tell whomever will listen.” Startups don’t win because their idea is original. In fact, in the early days, many people will think your idea is dumb (which doesn’t matter, because these people are not your customers). Startups win because of hard-earned execution. Building in public invites attention from all sorts of prospects: customers, employees, and even investors. All these inbounds may not be useful, but from my experience, a subset are typically accelerants for your business.In the early days at Savvy, our inclination was to build quietly. It was easy to justify—we were in a new market with a perceived first-mover advantage. We weren’t ready for the spotlight, and competitors would surely steal from our A+ product and marketing. Despite YC’s urging, we delayed a public launch, blog posts, or LinkedIn posts. In doing so, we inadvertently delayed sales inbounds from customers, an understanding of the segments most in need of our product, and market feedback. When speed is your only advantage as a startup, the costs of building in stealth far outweigh the benefits.For us, stealth mode delayed key learnings about our product’s fit with potential market segments, which likely amounted to a six-month setback.2 Fortunately, we realized our misconception and eventually changed course. I can’t say the same of other startups I’ve observed that are still operating in stealth, years after founding.4. Are you riding a wave or a riptide?Source: DALL-EAs first-time founders, we had heard of startup accelerator Y Combinator’s legendary history incubating young founders and their early startups (e.g. Stripe, Airbnb, Instacart, DoorDash, Coinbase). When starting Savvy in the fall of 2019, we applied with our idea to build modern employee health debit cards (e.g. FSA, HSA, etc.). Good news: YC selected us for an in-person interview! Not-so-great news: a week before the interview, we concluded from customer research that our idea didn’t have legs.Around this time, I received a cryptic email from a VC: “This looks interesting … check it out.” Attached was a draft copy of a new federal health insurance regulation that the Trump administration was working on. Employers could use payment cards similar to FSAs to let employees purchase their own health insurance plan from the open market (also known as the individual, ACA, or Obamacare market). This new option would disintermediate employers from selecting group health plans.Our immediate thought was that this new regulation-driven market was going to be massive, and we could be first movers. Our next thought was that although we had never sold health insurance, we needed to pivot quickly given our YC interview in three days. A poorly researched idea seemed better than a bad idea, so we pivoted to building payment cards for employee health insurance.In the final days leading up to our YC interview, we pored over the draft of the new regulation. One problem—we had little understanding of who would adopt this health insurance model. We needed to talk to customers, fast. An epiphany: the fastest way to talk to businesses was to just show up. We marched down Chestnut Street in SF and knocked on every small-business door. We proceeded to ask about their health insurance. Armed with these insights, when interview day came around, we confidently addressed the intense, 4-on-2 interview panel for precisely 10 minutes. Hours later, we received a call accepting Savvy into YC.Once YC kicked off, our focus quickly became growth. Each week, YC partners pulled us into “group office hours” with five other startups to grill us on customer traction. These sessions lit a fire. Terrified of being caught with our pants down in front of our peers, we sprinted seven days a week to sell our product to whomever would listen.When I say whomever, I mean literally anyone who would entertain a conversation. At YC’s first batch dinner, we recognized that drinks were missing from the menu. Founder thirst became our opportunity. We showed up with a cooler full of sparkling waters and a makeshift sign that read “Benefits & Bubbles.” In exchange for signing up with Savvy, we handed out drinks. To this day, that lemon-sparkling-water stand remains our highest-ROI marketing tactic.The startup before all startups: the lemonade stand!Even without a clear grasp of what problem we were solving and for whom, we began selling. But therein lay our mistake. We were amateur artists painting frescoes, blindfolded. Our thinking at the time seemed intuitive. The market’s willingness to buy would show us whether there was a big problem to solve. If there was no demand for our product, the signal would be clear. If we saw strong pull with rapid word-of-mouth growth, the market fit would also be obvious. However, there is a dangerous in-between outcome, which is precisely where we landed: steady sales with no acceleration.As customers ramped, it felt like we were winning. We even signed up several large companies, which 10x’d our user base overnight. In order to give these clients an incredible experience, we prioritized their feedback. With a two-person engineering team, we couldn’t always build their feature requests into the product, so we designed manual hacks. One large customer wanted Savvy to front all insurance payments on behalf of users. We began fronting funds (effectively a six-figure loan), remitting payment for users, reconciling everything in a spreadsheet, and billing the customer at month-end. We told ourselves that one day we would build technology to automate this, but for now, we’d take on the operations burden to keep the customer happy.Now, doing manual things that don’t scale isn’t bad strategy. Oftentimes, it is the optimal way to scope features and develop customer loyalty. Unfortunately for us, our large, early customers all churned. We found ourselves in a death spiral—these poor-fit customers took up ops and eng time, but before we could release features catering to their problems, they left us. What we missed at the outset is that they were bad-fit customers all along, simply willing to try a bite of the apple. As the cracks of our early startup product became exposed, they were happy to throw away their unfinished apple and pick another. Ultimately, they weren’t desperate enough for our solution. Said another way, they didn’t have a problem that we could uniquely solve.Key learnings from this part of our journey:Take the time to build conviction in a specific problem before pitching sales and writing code. This could take weeks or even months, but early customer research will accelerate time to product-market fit later. During this process, it will be easy to paint convincing but dishonest narratives. It’s critical to be brutally honest. The problem must be obvious and specific, and you should know who “good fit” customers are. Focus only on good fits.Perhaps counterintuitive: Pre-PMF you’re looking for overwhelming pull from the market or no sales at all. Remaining in between in the push-to-market territory for too long is dangerous. Some companies can find their way out of this riptide and onto a wave, but many (like Savvy) will not break free. If you find yourself paddling in the riptide, double down on customer research to understand whether your product or execution is limiting word-of-mouth adoption or if your assumptions on problem or market are incorrect. If you decide to keep building, be maniacally focused on customer behavior as you iterate and look for signs of market pull.5. Losing convictionYears after founding Savvy and emerging from Covid spring with $2.5 million in funding, we found ourselves once again searching for signal. After several months of tepid growth, we became pessimistic that our product was solving a big enough pain point for users. We ran experiments to see if we could sell to a different segment of the market who we thought more urgently experienced the problem our product solved. Again, we ran into issues selling. The buyer was apathetic and ill-incentivized to change. They often punted the buying decision to an outside advisor or broker. These advisors had their own set of misaligned incentives (welcome to U.S. health care), and the select few who were interested weren’t looking for the point solution we built.Kimber Lockhart, CTO of One Medical and Savvy investor, preparing our team for the chaos that is year-end insurance “open enrollment”When you bring a new product to market, you may make discoveries about your market or customer that reduce your belief in your product. These insights will not be immediate—it may take years of selling before arriving at a conclusion. You’ll likely try to pivot. Much has been written about the art of the pivot: altering your business while keeping one foot on the ground. Change the buyer, change your pricing model, change the product to serve a different user or use case, but stay focused on the same problem and market. However, pivoting may not work. What if you lose conviction in the market altogether?Earlier this year, we were asking this very question. Savvy was largely a bet on a new, regulation-driven market. When we lost conviction in our market’s growth, we turned to our investor and former Andreessen partner Louis Beryl for advice. He lit a fire: “It sounds like you’ve lost belief. The worst thing you can do now is do nothing. What you do is up to you, but by the next time we talk, you should have made a move.”We considered our options: shut down, restart, or sell the company. Shutting down requires little explanation—you let go of your team and shut your doors. Restarts are an option for companies like ours that still have cash remaining. The inherent difficulty is that after years focused on one problem with an existing team, you must start from scratch on something totally new, likely with a downsized team. Though hard to pull off, there are examples of success. Some years ago, a failing gaming startup performed a restart by taking its in-game communications technology and morphing it into an enterprise communications tool. This tool, of course, is now Slack.The option that is perhaps most desired by founders, but that they have the least control over, is the elusive acquisition. Certainly at Savvy, an acquisition seemed most compelling—returns for shareholders, a landing spot for the team, and a chance for our product to live on. While the road was a winding, serendipitous one, we successfully closed on an acquisition by the market leader in our industry.There is no one path to getting acquired, but I’ll share some tales and takeaways from our experience.6. How to land an acquisition as a startupIf acquirers come knocking, serve them tea.Some companies have acquisition targets on their backs seemingly since inception. They’ll receive unsolicited offers early, typically from a larger player in their industry. If you’re in this envious position, resist the urge to ignore these suitors even if the timing is off. When I was growing up in India, guests often showed up at our door uninvited. My family would always welcome them in, serve chai tea, hear the latest happenings, and send them off. Do the same with acquirers. Take the time to understand their interest and schedule infrequent touch points as you build. Savvy received an acquisition offer from Gusto early on. Naively, we declined without entertaining the offer and failed to engage them as we scaled. Years later when we were ready for acquisition talks, Gusto’s “strategy had shifted.”Startups are bought, not sold.As a nascent, unproven business, a startup actively looking for a buyer risks being perceived as a failing, problem-ridden entity. For this reason, as our advisor and One Medical CTO Kimber Lockhart explained to me, startups are bought, not sold. Is it possible to avoid this negative signaling? Yes, with some tact. When we spoke with potential acquirers, we hid our true intention behind the guise of partnership interest. We used a product partnership as our Trojan horse of sorts. As soon as we felt strong pull, we’d raise the idea of doing something “more strategic.” Now, is this a 100% transparent way to start a relationship? Maybe not, but it worked for us to successfully seed acquisition interest without raising doubts about our company. Proceed at your own risk!Time is not your friend.Acquisition processes are extremely fickle. They require escape velocity to overcome the inertia within big companies. We navigated many conversations where momentum seemed strong, only to be followed by radio silence. Time is not on your side—the more drawn-out processes become, the higher the likelihood of stalling momentum or a dissenting internal stakeholder.When we signed the term sheet to sell Savvy, we granted a four-week exclusive due diligence period. Just two weeks into this period, the stock market began a free fall, which we now recognize as the start of the current recession. With each passing day, we’d wake up to the S&P opening 1% to 3% lower. For technology stocks, our nearest comps, it was a bloodbath. While the deal was nearing the finish line, the acquirer was taking their sweet time (to be fair, they had two weeks of exclusivity remaining). I knew that we were now in wartime—I needed to ratchet up the intensity to get the deal closed. On every call with the acquirer to negotiate the final purchase agreement, I told them we were ready to sign imminently. When our lawyers were slow to respond over email, I implemented twice-daily standup calls to increase their velocity. Anytime I received an email from the acquiring company’s CEO or CFO, I replied within the hour. If I didn’t hear back quickly, I sent a text message referencing my email and reminding them of my enthusiasm to get the deal done. While perhaps aggressive, I knew that a bear market is no time to do big M&A deals. Time was not on our side.In just 48 hours, we finalized the legal documents and were in a position to sign. It was now Thursday. I knew that if we slipped into Friday, there was a risk the deal wouldn’t close until the following week. At 8 p.m. Central time, the CFO called me to say that they were missing signatures from their NYC-based board members. When I heard this, I was near ready to hop on a plane to New York and personally knock on the board members’ doors. I chose not to express this sentiment, but I let her know that I had an urgent personal issue on Friday and we needed to get this done tonight. She proceeded to text and call the outstanding individuals. Fortunately, they weren’t the types who went to bed without checking their phones, and submitted their consent. An hour later, the CFO called me again. This time, she was locked out of her bank account and couldn’t initiate the wire. She asked if we could push signing to Friday, given that it was now 10 p.m. her time. I could sense her fatigue, but even one day could risk the deal closing, with the turbulent macro backdrop. I pushed back and offered to call customer support on her behalf. Fortunately, she was able to get hold of her admin to unlock her account. Minutes later, we closed the deal.Time is not your friend—don’t be afraid to have uncomfortable conversations to get a deal across the line.Seek out decision makers.There’s a narrow set of people who can make an acquisition decision quickly. Typically, you’ll find a C and O in their title. This may be obvious, but get in front of this person without wasting time with subordinates. Your path in matters—a subordinate introducing a deal is much less compelling than the CEO bringing you in. While this wasn’t our ultimate path in, your investors may have board-level connections. These board-level intros can often be the highest-impact path in, so pursue this angle aggressively if available.3Build an acquisition funnel.We ran our acquisition process like a sales pipeline—build a large top-of-funnel, qualify leads quickly, and spend the majority of time with likely-to-close prospects. At the outset, we identified around 50 companies in our industry that would be most interested in our product. The list included companies across health-care payments, insurance brokerage, insurance, and HR software. When culling the list, we took into account size and scale (with a bias toward well-capitalized, mature companies), ability to move quickly (with a bias toward venture or PE-backed companies), and our likelihood of penetrating senior leadership (insert plug for LinkedIn Sales Navigator).Stop not till your (realistic) goal is reached.Startup acquisitions come in a few flavors: IP (technology/product acquisition), team (acqui-hire), or both (company acquisition). An IP or company sale are most accretive and least likely. The acqui-hire is simply a vehicle for another company to interview and selectively hire your team, though surprisingly not a cakewalk to secure. You should be honest about what’s realistic for your company and let this outcome inform the types of companies you reach out to.At Savvy, we were hopeful that the market would value the technology we had built. Many companies in the industry are unsophisticated when it comes to technology—our product, particularly with its unique payments features, would be an accretive acquisition. But we didn’t want to be left at the altar, so we ran parallel processes, one for company acquisition and another for acqui-hire. We started with 50 potential acquirers, but the list narrowed after two months of conversations (where we found a way in) to just a handful of interested parties. A Sequoia-backed health-care staffing company was moving fast to acquire our team. As we were finalizing that conversation, we received last-minute interest in a full company acquisition from the market leader in our industry. We were torn. We knew our team was excited about joining a hyper-growth, Sequoia-backed startup. That said, we wanted to maximize value and also see the fruits of our three-year labor live on. We decided to be transparent with the health-care incumbent to understand if they’d consider buying only our technology, IP, and customers, leaving our team out of the equation. Fortunately, they were enthusiastic. We were lucky to get both processes across the finish line.Savvy was acquired by Take Command Health in June 2022, and much of our team joined Clipboard Health around that same time.E-signing the docs—Savvy’s acquisition closed in June 2022Thank you for sharing your story, Suril 🙏Suril is currently advising startups on go-to-market while exploring new ideas in climate and fintech.

When we were faced with the decision to pivot or pursue a sale, our team weighed on us. We felt that a pivot would be painful at our size, and the potential products we could pivot to were limited if we wanted to keep everyone on the team. This reality led us to pursue a sale.2It’s challenging to quantify the real impact. Perhaps we would have received more leads and learned from an inability to close sales that our product wasn’t solving an urgent need. We wouldn’t have been fooled by our early growth metrics, and maybe we would have pivoted within months of launch to a different product. We’ll never really know.3Friendly reminder: Make it easy for your investors to work for you.

I’m Lenny and each week I tackle reader questions about product, growth, and working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out at the office 🤜🤛P.S. Don’t miss the follow-up to this post: How today's fastest-growing B2B startups turned their early users into paying customersQ: How did the fastest growing B2B businesses find their first ten customers?“In the early days of Figma, we talked with practically every designer we knew. In search of more feedback, we turned to Twitter which I realized we could use to determine the most influential designers. After getting the data, I further filtered the list to people that were personally inspirational to me. Then I cold emailed / found introductions to many of these people and showed them Figma.”— Dylan Field, CEOHere, Dylan shares how he leveraged (what turns out to be) two of three growth levers used by essentially every B2B businesses to get started:👋 Tapping your personal network (i.e. his friends)🧗‍♀️ Seeking out your customers where they are (i.e. Twitter)🗞 Getting pressBelow, you’ll learn how twenty other hyper-growth B2B businesses found their earliest customers — including stories from Shopify, Stripe, Airtable, Plaid, Gusto, Salesforce, Slack and many more. A number of these stories are being shared publicly for the first time. In a follow-up post (for paid-subscribers only), I’ll share how these companies closed their first ten customers.Why first ten customers? Because that’s when you’re most scrappy and doing things that don’t scale. In follow-up posts, I’m also going to look into how these companies approached their first 100, and then 1,000 customers. Stay tuned.I hadn’t actually planned on digging into this topic, but immediately after publishing a piece about early consumer app growth, I began getting this question from B2B founders. I couldn’t resist digging in, and I’m happy I didn’t. I ended up spending 40+ hours digging through old interviews, seeking out warm introductions to founders, and sliding into countless DMs. It turns out getting these early B2B stories was a lot harder than it was for consumer apps ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ This post was only possible thanks to the generosity of countless founders, early employees, and tons of helpful Twitter friends who contributed to this post in some way. You can find the full list of contributors at end of the post. Thank you all ❤️Without further ado, let’s dive in!Biggest takeaways:Only three sourcing strategies account for every B2B company’s very early growth (unlike the seven strategies for consumer apps). Thus, your choices are easy, yet limited.In practice, it’s even easier — almost every B2B business BOTH hits up their personal network AND heads to the places their potential customers were spending time. The question isn’t which of these two routes to pursue, but instead how far your own network will take you before you move on.It’s a huge advantage to have a strong personal network in B2B, which you can also build by bringing on a connector investor or joining an incubator such as YC.Tapping your personal network is even more important if you need to “sell” your product (i.e. not going bottom-up), likely because early customers need to have a reason to trust you.Getting press is rarely the way to get startedRead on for the strategies and stories. Just for fun I’ve included screenshot of what each company’s website looked like early-on 🤪Strategy 1: Tap your personal network 👋Key question: Who in your network could be a potential customer?Slack — Friends“We begged and cajoled our friends at other companies to try it out and give us feedback. We had maybe six to ten companies to start with that we found this way. The pattern was to share Slack with progressively larger groups. We amplified the feedback we got at each stage by adding more teams.” — Stewart Butterfield, CEO (source)Asana — Friends and former colleagues“Almost all of (our first ~15 users) are people we are personally close to. We're currently focused on making them really happy with their experience – rounding out the feature set, responding to their feedback, fixing bugs, and improving performance.As that continues, we'll continue to roll the alpha product out gradually to more and more people. There probably won't be any particular floodgate moment, more of a steady influx of new users.”— Justin Rosenstein, CPO and co-founder (source)Salesforce — Former colleagues“It was challenging to convince prospects to try our service, and it was especially challenging to convince the first one. Most people don’t want to be the first to take a giant risk. Realizing that truism was pivotal. We finessed our strategy to target pioneers who saw an opportunity to participate in something new and exciting.That first pioneer came in the form of Blue Martini Software, one of the small software companies in which I had previously invested. I knew I was asking for a favor when I called the founder, Monte Zweben, but I also knew I was offering something that he really needed. […]We did not have a formal sales organization at this time so in our quest for early customers, everyone on the salesforce.com team was encouraged to contact anyone he or she knew in any industry, or at any start-up. Diane Mark, our product manager, won our second client while she was standing in line at the local market, Mollie Stone’s. She ran into a former colleague who was working as a sales manager at iSyndicate, a company that sold syndicated content over the Web. She asked him what the company used to manage its sales process. “ACT! And Excel,” he replied. “It’s a mess.”— Marc Benioff, CEO (source)Carta — Investors“Our very early customers came from two places:The angel investors in our company: Andy Palmer from Tamr was an investor in eShares, and brought it into his company early on.Sister portfolio founders: We had this personal connection to them through our investors.Other than that, it was just working the network.”— Joshua Merrill, ex-CPOGusto — Friends and incubator peers“Gusto's first 10 customers came from friends we knew who were just starting their businesses in CA. Mostly new tech startups from our YC batch, but also non-tech small businesses (like a children's swimming camp) that we happened to know through family and friends. We basically (three founders) went around telling everyone we knew that we're building a modern delightful payroll and HR system and asked if they'd know someone who'd be interested in trying it out.”— Tomer London, CPO and co-founderStripe — Friends and incubator peers“At YC we use the term Collison installation for the technique they invented. More diffident founders ask Will you try our beta? and if the answer is yes, they say Great, we'll send you a link. But the Collison brothers weren't going to wait. When anyone agreed to try Stripe they'd say ‘Right then, give me your laptop’ and set them up on the spot.”— Paul Graham (source)“Our first user actually became one of the first employees at Stripe. I had known Ross Boucher for a couple of years. We were working on a payments system, and he needed a payments system, so I just suggested, hey, do you want to try this out? I didn’t emphasize how early on it was was. What indicated to us that there was something interesting here was that our friends who were using it asked if they could invite their friends, and those people invited their friends, and it spread through word of mouth process.”— Patrick Collison, CEO (source)Amplitude — Incubator peers“Amplitude's first customers came from the YC network. Spenser and Curtis were working on another startup called Sonalight during YC and built an early version of Amplitude to answer why users weren't retaining – other YC companies in their cohort wanted to use it too since they had questions existing tools couldn't answer. They quickly realized Amplitude was their biggest opportunity.”— Tai Rattigan, ex-Head of PartnershipsWorkday — Former colleagues“Workday's earliest customers consisted mostly of midsize-company CEOs who knew the founders. They bought the friendship, not the software.”— Dave Duffield, ex-CEO (source)Looker — Former colleagues and investors“Networks are one of the most important but often overlooked opportunities in the B2B space. Looker was fortunate enough to acquire its first 10+ customers via networks (and we continue to benefit from networks to this day). This wasn't just our personal network, but our customer's & investor's networks as well. To get the most out of these networks we simply did two things:Spent endless energy on making our early customers as successful and happy as we possibly could.Asked our customers to share their success with others by putting a few simple programs in place to allow them to evangelize.”— Keenan Rice, early employee and VP Strategic Alliances at LookerCoda — Former colleagues“When we started Coda, we decided to build in stealth so we could stay focused on the product and stay out of the public eye. Our first alpha trial was with a small startup run by a past colleague of mine from YouTube. The whole company used the product productively for a couple months, but then they all churned in one day. It was a low point for us — losing 100% of your user base in one day is tough!Thankfully, the startup CEO was very supportive and gave us great feedback ーthe team was aligned with the vision of what we were building, but required a list (a long list!) of specific action items to complete before they would try Coda again. That feedback motivated us and led to a much better product. Key lesson: the customers you lose may be the source of your best feedback.”— Shishir Mehrotra, CEOOkta — Former colleagues“We reached out to our networks, folks we knew in IT from Salesforce.com and past jobs. We networked aggressively on LinkedIn with our alma mater networks etc. We asked our angel investors and combed their LinkedIn networks. I had a target of 15-18 net new IT folks / different companies to talk to every month for the first 6 months and probably hit 85% + of my quota.”— Frederic Kerrest, COO and co-founderIntercom — Former colleagues“It was basically ‘Do things that make people find out about Intercom’. Our previous businesses had helped us grow a network of people who would listen to us, so they were the first people we reached out to. So all day every day I’d email people to tell them about Intercom, show them what Intercom might look like for them, and hear their feedback. I did this 100% by hand and if I was to do it all again today I’d still do it by hand. Honestly.

That pointed me to building Shopify. We had an early waitlist, with a few thousand emails that we launched to. This was in 2006. Looking back, it actually set the pattern for a lot of SaaS. We launched the beta and had a few hundred stores. Still some of those cohort selling today!”— Tobi Lütke, CEONew Relic — Ruby on Rails community“New Relic started in late 2007, focused squarely on the relatively small but rapidly growing Ruby on Rails market. At that time, Rails was growing in reputation but, it was far from mainstream…I figured it was a good market opportunity for a new startup: not too big to attract a ton of well funded competition, but large enough (and more importantly growing quickly enough) to support an early stage company.Rails developers are known for adopting the latest technologies, and passionately supporting products that rock, while brutally and vocally criticizing products don't meet their high standards. We were not the first product to target the Rails market, but we believe we had a strong product that immediately earned the support from thought leaders in the rails community. These included highly visible members of the Rails community like DHH, Tobi Luetke, Rick Olson, Obie Fernandez, Tom Mornini and many others. This kind of endorsement can't be bought; it needs to be earned. It had amazing impact on our early traction.”— Lew Cirne, CEO (source)Plaid — Online developer and PM communities“Prior to Plaid, we spent 9 months building consumer financial products, and ended up deciding to create Plaid out of our own frustration with the lack of good infrastructure. We actually became our own first customer. From there, we mostly grew through word of mouth in the developer and product manager community. We invested in meeting founders of fintech companies, learning their problems, and seeing how Plaid could help. Lots of time spent on forums, IRC, meetups, and working with startup accelerators.” — Zach Perret, CEO and co-founderFigma — Twitter“In the early days of Figma, we talked with practically every designer we knew. In search of more feedback, we turned to Twitter which I realized we could use to determine the most influential designers. After getting the data, I further filtered the list to people that were personally inspirational to me. Then I cold emailed / found introductions to many of these people and showed them Figma. At the time, Figma was early, but this resulted in all sorts of incredible feedback. As we evolved the product, we kept these designers in the loop about what was changing. By the time we launched, we had built a relationship with these customers and many amplified our message.

Each week I tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out about work.SubscribeAs an angel investor, you often get asks from founders—but you rarely get an ask this personalized, crisp, and easy to act on:Of his many superpowers, Sam Corcos (CEO of Levels) is in a league of his own when it comes to leveraging his investor network to help him build his company. I’ve never seen anything like it. I believe this one skill has contributed significantly to his company’s success. So I asked Sam to share his in-the-weeds advice about how to make the most of your investor network. Boy did he deliver. If you’re a founder, this post is for you.Note, I’m an angel investor in Levels, which is how I uncovered this superpower. If you’d like to go deeper, Levels shares their previous investor updates and all-hands meetings publicly, and you can follow Sam on Twitter and LinkedIn. Enjoy!I talk to a lot of founders who feel like they were sold a bill of goods by their “value add” investor, who ends up doing very little for them. I can tell you from personal experience that it’s almost always the founder’s fault that they aren’t getting value from their investors.From June 27, 2019, to October 26, 2022 (about 3 years and 4 months), I personally sent 2,626 requests to our investor network. Of those emails sent out, 1,664 received a response, and 1,151 were able to deliver on what was asked.Investors have very little context into what your company is doing or what you need help with, so it’s unreasonable to expect them to proactively find ways to add value. You need to learn how to ask. This might sound simple, but it actually takes a lot of practice, and most founders are not good at it.I think activating one’s investor network is one of the biggest untapped sources of value at most startups. In this article, we’ll go over a few tactics for how to build a great investor network and how to activate them to get as much value as possible.Executive summaryBuild a great network by optimizing for eigenvector centrality.Make good asks by keeping them targeted, time-bounded, and specific.If you want someone to help you, make it as easy as possible for them.Do the work. Don’t expect to receive value without putting in effort.First, build a great investor networkWhat makes an investor network great? Just like with hiring, it’s about getting the right people on board; doing it right takes time. If you develop the skill of activating your investor network, it’ll be well worth the time.The place we should start is at a higher level of abstraction, and think about networks and graphs in general. The way you structure a network has significant implications for how the network performs. We’ll only cover the high-level concepts here, but if you want to do a deeper dive on network theory, I discussed these concepts in more detail in the podcast episodes I did of Funded with Jason Yeh (Part 1, Part 2).Eigenvector centralityTo build a really powerful network, you should optimize for what is known as eigenvector centrality:Eigenvector centrality is an algorithm that measures the transitive influence of nodes.In other words, it’s not “how many people you know”; it’s “how many people all the people you know, know.”When people think about how well-networked or popular someone is, they typically think about it through the lens of degree centrality. A person with high degree centrality is a mayor of a small town, or the most popular kid in high school. Within the context of a network where everyone knows each other, they are the most connected person in that dense network:The dark purple node has the highest degree centralityA failure mode of building a network that is optimized for degree centrality is that everyone ends up being similar, and it’s extremely limiting when you have a request that is outside of your normal area of influence.For example, if you create an amazing network of financiers, that’s probably helpful for fundraising, but not if you need to hire engineers, find a mentor for product strategy, or any of the thousands of other kinds of problems you’ll need to solve as a founder.It’s for this reason that you want to focus your attention on adding new people to the network from other dense networks that you don’t already have access to. The ideal network for a founder is one where you know the person with the highest degree centrality in each network:There’s a lot of evidence that this is true, both from personal experience and academia. For a deeper dive on this, I recommend reading the classic 1973 paper by Mark Granovetter, “The Strength of Weak Ties.”Setting up your network this way significantly increases the chances that you’ll be successful in activating your investors, because you have access to the most possible surface area of connections and expertise.To give you a sense of the diversity of backgrounds of the people we optimized for when building our investor network, here are the backgrounds of the first 15 people in alphabetical order. For reference, these cover only about 5% of the people we have engaged as investors and don’t even get us beyond the letter “a” alphabetically:Insurance founderHealth tech founderHealth and wellness writerYouTube creatorProfessional basketball playerProduct leader at major tech companyPartnerships leader at organic foods companyGrowth leader at direct-to-consumer software companyTalent network company founderPartner at major consulting firmInternational expansion leader at major tech companyPodcast hostSales leader at Fortune 500 companyEducation tech founderWellness-focused venture capitalistYou should also give some attention to other networks you may need to access in the future, no matter how unrelated they might seem today. Having a single entry point into a network is infinitely more valuable than having zero. It makes a huge difference if you know one professional basketball player, one person who is an insurance industry executive, or one person in state government.It’s always best to have every possible type of diversity of people on your cap table. Some of our highest-value angel investors were people with little to no public persona. These tend to be early employees at post-IPO companies who have some liquidity and more time available. Some of our most trajectory-changing advice came from people like Alex Cunningham, Ellen DaSilva, Razvan Roman, Alexey Komissarouk, and other active operators who are under the radar but have a lot to contribute.For some people, you’ll only be able to get their attention for a few minutes per month. Others, you can ask for a few hours per quarter. Having a mix of both is a huge asset.Set expectationsIt’s also important to set expectations early. Ideally, you should be thinking about building your investor network as solving for a matching problem rather than a sales problem (i.e. you’re looking to find the right match, not convince them to join).If you expect your investors to be actively involved, you should let them know before you accept their money. This is really important because it gives you permission to hold them accountable to what they’ve agreed to, and many investors will opt out (example below). That’s fine! People have different priorities and availability. It’s not personal.Here’s an actual snippet that I’ve sent to several investors to set early expectations:For example, here’s a conversation I had with a potential investor where, after setting clear expectations that we’d like them to be actively involved, they opted out because they didn’t have bandwidth. And there’s nothing wrong with that! Where these situations get tricky is when those expectations aren’t set early on and one side feels like the other is being unreasonable.Then, activate your networkOnce you have a network of capable investors involved, you need to spend time extracting value from your cap table.

Many founders think you only get a certain number of “chips” to cash in with your investors (this is an analogy I’ve heard many times). This mindset is not accurate, but it tends to develop after a series of unresponded-to emails to their investors. But most of the time, the investors aren’t responding because the asks are bad.In general, people like being helpful—especially investors! It’s a big part of their job. You know the joy you experience when you’re able to help out another founder? By not asking for things, you’re denying other people that joy. Personally, I love it when I’m able to make an easy intro or give some quick advice to someone that changes the trajectory of their project.Set them up for success by making good asks.What to askAs a founder, you should always know what you and your team need. I have a snippet in TextExpander called “asks” that I paste in anytime someone says, “How can I be helpful?” in an email, which I then pare down to just the requests that are relevant to them. Most people would be shocked at how many times that simple action has led to significant value creation.Every month, my EA sends a message to our team asking them for two things that they could use help with. The responses are consolidated and added to our investor update, and I add them to my list as well.You should make it easy for your team to tell you what they need, but you should also do the work yourself. If you’re the founder, you likely have the most context of anyone else at the company, so your investor asks are probably the highest-leverage in the organization. If you can’t think of anything you need help with, you’re not thinking hard enough. Everyone at every stage needs support.How to askYou should approach your investor asks like you would approach building a product. Think about it from the perspective of the person receiving the request. How do you make it easy for them?If I had to simplify what makes for a good investor ask into three main concepts, they would be:Targeted: Only send them to the people who are relevantTime-bounded: Ideally, executing the request should take less than a minuteSpecific: Be specific in your request, and limit the scope of the request (see chunking bias)Instead of going through each of these concepts individually, we’ll go through a bunch of examples below to show you what a good investor ask looks like.On a tactical level, we don’t use any special tooling other than email and a list of our investors in a Google Sheet. Anytime we need to send out an investor ask, I skim the list and I personally send an email to each person who I think might be able to contribute. That’s all. No need to overcomplicate it.I find it helpful to ask each investor what kinds of things they typically help with and write them down (I was impressed with one investor in particular who maintains a Notion doc with everything he can help with), but in general, whenever I have an ask, I spend 5 to 10 minutes looking through the list of people and sending emails to the folks who I think might be willing and able to help. Here’s a redacted screenshot of a subset of the Google Sheet:Computers are good at remembering things (like maintaining a list of everyone you have access to), and humans are good at connecting the dots. In my experience, it’s best to use computers for keeping lists of things and use one’s brain to do anything involving people, like crafting and sending asks. The hard part is committing to put in the work. No tool can help with that.Examples1.

Marc is a friend, a former colleague, and a prolific angel investor. He has personally helped dozens of startups raise money (even doing this full-time for a number of years). When I got this question, I went straight to Marc and asked him to do a guest post. Not only did he agree, he ended up putting together the most comprehensive fundraising guide I’ve ever seen, which you’ll find below. Thank you Marc 🙏If you have any further questions, don’t hesitate to ping Marc on Twitter.P.S. You can hear this post in audio form 👇A Playbook for FundraisingBy Marc McCabeImage: Gilbert GarcinFor an early stage founder, fundraising is one of the most nerve-racking parts of the job. It’s incredibly opaque, asymmetrical, and is often the difference between having a company and not. Even the most experienced founder may have only fundraised 5-10 times in their life, while VCs engage in this process daily.Nonetheless, it’s also a very exciting time for a founder. Very few people ever get the chance to raise millions of dollars from top tier VCs. As a result, I often see founders rush into the process, setting up investor meetings before they’re truly prepared and end up with a bad outcome. This is a missed opportunity because the fundraising process is a great forcing-function for getting you to think deeply about your business and where it’s going.Over the last decade I have personally helped dozens of companies raise capital, from pre-seed to Series C rounds, and through these experiences I’ve seen a lot of effective, and also counterproductive, fundraising patterns. I shared many of these learnings in a lengthy podcast interview a year ago in, but with a prod from Lenny I felt like now was a good time to revisit this topic.This guide is for founders of technology businesses who have raised their seed round, and are thinking forward to their next fundraise. It’s most relevant for Series A, but a lot of the same concepts apply for seed rounds, Series B and to a certain extent Series C. While most tech businesses can benefit from this guide, there are plenty of exceptions, especially companies with products which take a long time to get to market, and companies raising capital outside the US. Consider yourself caveated.Ultimately, fundraising is an exercise in building trust. Every week we read about new Series A, B and C rounds. We hear about pre-emptive offers and blank check term sheets from prominent investors. All of this can lull us into thinking raising capital is easy. Yet, each partner at a fund generally only makes 1-3 early-stage investments per year, and their career is ultimately staked to how successful these investments are. Each investment is incredibly significant to each fund and in order to convince a fund that you are worthy of that big check, you need them to feel incredibly confident that you will take the money and use it to take your business to a new level, whereby you could raise future funding and ultimately build a huge business. With that in mind, let’s get started with how I like to manage the various steps from thinking about fundraising to closing. I typically break up a fundraising process into 4 steps:PreparationOutreachNavigating the processPartner meetings + closingLet’s walk through each of these stages one by one.Step 1: PreparationFirst, you need to figure out why and when you should raise a round. Maybe this seems obvious, but rather than looking at new investment as an opportunity, many founders only start fundraising when they are running out of money. VC’s don’t invest because you’re running out of money – they invest because they believe their equity stake will be worth a lot more in the future.When you should raise a Series A round is a blog post unto itself, and I’m not going to go in depth here. The truth is that there isn’t just one factor that will say you’re ready to raise Series A. For example, in SaaS, it’s common that companies that have achieved $1M ARR are told they are ready, but growth rate is a factor as well, and ARR doesn’t always apply for consumer focused businesses. Generally the way to think about whether you are ready for a Series A is whether you’ve proven a credible value hypothesis. This is a combination of factors including the market you’re attacking, the features you’ve built to exploit the opportunity, and how well your product is finding its fit in the market. I often describe Series A as the “Product-Market Fit Round”: You want to show that you’ve convinced a slice of your market that your product is valuable enough to pay for (or if it’s free, use very regularly), and that this user base is growing. While seed rounds are intended to explore an idea and find some fit in the market, raising a Series A helps you pour more fuel on the fire.Investors ultimately want to invest in growth. If a company is growing fast relative to its peers, this can make up for lower ARR especially if the business seems defensible and sustainable. It’s often helpful to speak with your seed investors early on about it, especially if they have experience raising capital themselves, to understand what milestones would make most sense to support a new round in the future.When you think that you’re ready, the first step is to start pulling together your key metrics and wins, such as your growth rates, revenue numbers, customer testimonials, user feedback, and achievements. As mentioned, what makes you ready for Series A varies greatly, so find data points that will get investors excited about your business.In terms of materials, I advise founders to prepare the following at a minimum:A short blurb about your business, including a couple of headline numbers that indicate the business is doing wellA short teaser deck (3-7 slides)A longer presentation deck (12-15 slides)A 2-3 year forecast with assumed fundraise securedOptional: Metrics deck or a data room. Sometimes you will get asked for this at Series A, sometimes not. It helps if you ask your prospective VCs in the first meeting whether they’ll ask for it.You can find some good references for building pitches here, here and here.The key is that your materials tell a compelling story. They need to explain what you’re building, why you’re building it, and how your strategy will capture considerable revenue in the future. The better this story ties everything together, the more your business will seem insightful. Ultimately we’re all human, and strong narratives that help explain the world around us are more compelling than a selection of disparate, albeit impressive, data points. “If you can’t tell a credible and compelling story about your vision and how your plans will capitalize on broader societal, market, cultural, economic or other trends, you’re dead in the water. I believe my own secret to fundraising success was that I always spoke to the broader changes I saw happening in the world and my conviction about the opportunities they presented.”— Eoghan McCabe, co-founder IntercomAs an early investor in Intercom, it always impressed me how consistent the narrative stayed from when the company started up until today.The shorter teaser deck is for sharing over email but be mindful that you don’t want to share everything with VCs ahead of meeting your lead partner. Hence the longer deck for your in-person (or Zoom meetings). Remember, it’s a trust building exercise. In a relationship, trust is built over many interactions over a long period of time. You want to show some positive elements to get investors interested, but leave good content in reserve.One thing that Covid has changed is that building a relationship with a VC, with fewer in-person meetings, is now harder. Think about this with respect to your materials. To make up for the lack of in-person face time, you need to find more digital approaches to building this relationship than before. Caitlin Bolnick recently had an excellent thread about this  so consider preparing some of the following extra materials:A Loom of your product flow explaining how you made key design decisions and how these relate to the use case or marketAn appendix of interesting information you yourself have read or viewed that inspired your approachA compilation of customer testimonials You will need more content than ever to help build a shared belief in what you’re doing and why. I typically recommend spending at least 4 weeks building the deck and supporting materials. I find founders realize there are stronger elements they should have included 1-2 weeks into the pitch process. Taking time to get the narrative right and letting your points crystallize will likely result in a stronger deck from the start. An important component in building this content is a part of the process I like to call “Hardening the Pitch”. Typically I recommend founders prepare their materials to about 70% completeness and then test them before going into battle. Put together a coherent story with great supporting data (not necessarily heavily designed). Find 4-6 people in your network, who have either fundraised at Series A for their own startup (ideally in the same or similar space), are friendly investors who know the space (perhaps from your seed investors), or even growth stage investors. Practice your pitch with them. Testing your materials and thesis before you hit the full pitch gauntlet will build your confidence and reps on the pitch. It will also provide you with helpful feedback and, potentially, warm introductions to relevant funds. I’ve seen this be immensely helpful in securing strong investment leads.“Fundraising can be a lonely experience, especially as you will want to protect those in the company from the highs and lows during your round. Finding some good external people to lean on for vetting your pitch or providing introductions can really help relieve some of the burden on founders.”— Jonathan Golden, NEAI generally think you should plan to spend somewhere between 8-16 weeks working on your fundraise from start to term-sheet. You’ll be ideally speaking to 50-60 funds for your Series A. Starting early in the year makes sense, but if you’re in July and contemplating raising, it might make sense to wait for late August or early September to begin your outreach to funds. There are a lot of great jokes I could share about VC vacations in August, but the truth is that plenty of VCs work through August. Just maybe not enough to run a tight process with every fund.Another factor to consider when you go out to raise is runway. Generally I recommend having at least 8 months of runway when going out to raise. The most important thing is that your business is showing the signs that you should raise Series A. If you only have 4-6 months of runway, it might make sense to raise a bridge round from inside investors to gain leverage in the fundraising process. You will want to continue to show traction during the fundraising process as often investors ask for updated numbers as you get close to the end and a downturn can shake their confidence. It’s really helpful to think about fundraising at least 12 months before you need it so you can time things well. I pulled together a quick fundraising calendar below to help you think about the overall timing of the different elements of your round.Step 2: OutreachPlanning your outreach is probably the most overlooked and tedious part of building a successful process. Your goal at this stage is to build a long list of funds who could lead your round. This means finding not just any funds, but those who have the capital to write a lead check. A lead check is one that can fill the majority of your round. You’ll also then need to identify the partners at these funds who will be interested in what you’re working on, and then find suitable introductions to speak with those partners. I recommend putting together a list of 50-60 funds you want to talk to (here’s a template). With that list, figure out the partner you’d ideally want to work with at the fund, and then comb through your network to identify strong introductions to those partners. Warm introductions can make a huge difference. The best intro comes from a successful founder from within that fund’s existing portfolio. The stronger the referral source, the more interest and excitement that partner will have when meeting you and reviewing your pitch content. If your only point of contact is a principal or associate at a fund then you may want to check in with them ahead of time. Associates and Principles are the eyes and ears of a fund, and can be a good path in, but you should ask them if they have autonomy to make investments or if there’s a partner at the fund they recommend you start building a relationship with.If you think you might fundraise in the next 6-12 months, and don’t have many good relationships with funds, this is a good time to start having some basic coffee meetings with top tier investors your network can introduce you to. If you’re seeing very strong traction and your value proposition is very clear, you probably won’t need to do these kinds of meetings. However, I have also seen that sometimes starting cold with investors when you begin fundraising isn’t always optimal. You should be cautious about doing too many of these coffee meetings because it’s time consuming and requires preparation, so I usually advise only doing this for top tier funds you want to cultivate a relationship with. You need to think of every investor interaction as something that could influence whether they do or don’t invest in your business, so make sure you prepare. Over the coming months you can continue these initial relationships with updates about your progress and the space you’re in.What is important though is that you set yourself up well with these funds before you start eventually reaching out for fundraising.Step 3: Navigating the processYou now have your pitch materials and your investor list ready. Your ultimate goal is to end up with multiple interested funds who have completed their diligence and want to invest all at the same time.You should coordinate your outreach to have first meetings with all of these funds within a 2-3 week period. Making sure all these first pitches happen in a constrained period of time means you won’t have some VCs getting ahead of the others in terms of information and diligence. Generally I don’t recommend doing more than 4-5 pitches a day and leaving a suitable buffer each side of pitches to restore your energy, give you time to get to your next meeting without stress, and to allow a meeting to go late when they need to. With 50-60 funds, that’s going to take 3 weeks.At the end of each meeting you should be asking your prospective partner:What kind of diligence do they need to get through to build confidence?What is their next step in moving this process forward?When might that next step happen?What parts of the business resonate with them?Approach this with the eyes of a project manager. You should be building a calendar and keeping notes for each VC’s progress and feedback, per the tracker template, and be in regular contact with each fund you’re speaking to. Having lots of content you can share helps. No one likes sending (or receiving) the “just checking in” email. Compose some interesting emails with relevant content that will help build understanding about what you’re doing and why. Always finish these emails with actions and next steps that can move things forward. It’s important to maintain dialogue and stay top-of-mind with the partner you’re speaking to.I’ll restate this because it’s important: try to keep all the funds on similar timelines. You may end up getting your first term sheet from the fund you are least excited about. If another fund you’re keen on is just starting their diligence you’ll be forced to either reject that better fund, or reject the deal you have on the table. You should think of your role here as creating a market for the equity you’re selling. Don’t create a market of one buyer that was able to get to a decision fastest. Once you’re through the grueling first pitch phase, you’ll move on to a second pitch, along with customer references, VCs diligencing your data, projections, etc. Once again, focus on coordination. To keep everyone moving, it’s OK to follow-up and share some information a week after your last touch point. If you’re driving everything and there’s seemingly no corresponding interest for a week or two, then better to file that VC in a different bucket and focus on the funds who are reciprocating. If someone says they’re going to follow up then the laws of human decency dictate they should (though that doesn’t always happen when you want it to).This will be painful, but know that some VCs just won’t be interested in your company or will be too focused on other deals. Some genuinely just won’t understand your business and the opportunity you see. Silence, or outright rejection, are tough pills to swallow for any founder, but this is normal. Having five VC partners still interested in investing after the diligence phase is a success. Another way of looking at that is that success normally means failing with 90%+ of the funds on your list. Y Combinator estimates you need to speak to 30 funds to get one term sheet. Still, you need to treat each fund with the respect that shows you believe they might lead your round, while avoiding wasting time with those that clearly show you they won’t. The later the passes come, the harder it’ll be to take, especially considering the time you’ve invested and the optimism you may have built up about their interest. This is unavoidable. Find ways to process and deal with this energy and try not to take it out on the investor in question. I’d genuinely recommend having a close friend/colleague/early investor who ideally understands the process on stand-by either to vent to or to get reassurance. Fundraising is, in the parlance of our times, a total head fuck. Rather than obsessing on the passes, focus on what next steps you can actually take to make progress with other funds.Step 4: Partner meetings + closingIf you’ve made it this far, kudos, you’ll need that kind of perseverance to fundraise successfully. You’ve now built some relationships and some fund partners have genuinely spent a lot of time on your business. Find ways to speak with those partners and show your true ambition and excitement for the deal. You’re possibly going to be working with this partner for years to come and they’re also thinking the same thing. At this point it’s likely that the partner wants to get this deal done but needs to convince their partnership. This is when you get called into partner meetings.The partner you’ve been working with now generally turns into your co-conspirator. They’ve invested months into this process and want to get the deal over the line. Delian Asparouhov, from Founders Fund, and I recently chatted about this dynamic and I think he summed it up best:“The world of venture capital actually closely mimics enterprise sales in this manner. Once your 'inside sponsor' has gotten over the line, then you are actually on the same team. The best founders recognize this and treat me like we're on the same side. We start to talk about how to tailor the deck to the firm, discuss and agree on an exact timeline for a term sheet, and what terms they would happily take.”— Delian Asparouhov, Founders FundTypically you will get a response one way or another shortly after a partner meeting. If you get a term sheet, congrats! If there are other funds still interested, you can let them know you have a term sheet and that they’ll need to make a decision soon. Most of the time, I would not recommend sharing which fund offered you the term sheet or what the valuation is. However, transparency can be perceived as a sign of confidence and that you’re ready to accept that term sheet. If the term sheet is from a top tier fund, this can also have an impact on the VCs still in your process. If this term-sheet is not from your first choice fund, asking to speak to references for a fund can buy you some time and give you additional insight on the fund. If you leverage a term-sheet to push another fund to make a decision and they have not completed their diligence, it can force them to pass when they might not otherwise. VCs don’t like offering term sheets that don’t get accepted – it’s a lot of work for nothing. Sometimes before getting the term sheet, you will get a call from the partner you’ve been speaking with. They’ll often ask you how many other funds are still involved, what you value the business at, and how much equity you’re willing to sell. It’s good to understand some comps and have a range of valuation in mind but don’t feel compelled to give them a low number they can anchor to. I would focus your comps around the top end of your range if you feel compelled to discuss a valuation with your VC partner. Don’t forget, you’ve built this synchronized process keeping many funds in the loop for a reason. Rather than helping the fund set a valuation (which they probably have a clearer idea of than you), focus the conversation on what you want to raise, reiterate why you need this capital, and potentially identify other terms you may be more sensitive about (e.g. one board seat vs two, option pools, founder stock revesting in later rounds). YC put together a very nice post on the ideal Series A term-sheet, but it’s also good to speak with your legal support to get advice on what terms they typically see. Always have your legal team review a term-sheet and walk you through the terms. Your legal team will likely be quite conservative and sensitive to terms which might not really impact you so it’s helpful to ask them clarifying questions like “when will this actually impact me?” to get clearer on what you can stomach and what you want to negotiate.Once you receive a term sheet, you are on the clock to accept, negotiate or reject it. Some VCs are aggressive with this and will only give you 24-48 hours to accept. Others understand you may need more time to gather references for the fund. There’s not a hard and fast rule here but it can be hard to keep a term sheet open for more than 1-2 weeks. When you get the term sheet, you should establish clearly how much time you will need and understand that if you go beyond this deadline, the term sheet could be withdrawn. Once you’ve signed a term-sheet, some founders are surprised to find out the process isn’t fully over. I advise you to not publicly celebrate a term sheet or necessarily tell anyone in the company outside of the founders. It can take 3-6 weeks from this point to actually get the money in the bank. During this time funds will perform some additional legal diligence, and prepare the stock purchase agreement (which is the more detailed and contractually binding version of the term-sheet). This is a good time to identify who out of your existing investors will be taking their pro-rata (if they have it), or find other value add angels and small investors who might be good fits for supporting you.Once you sign the stock purchase agreement you can breathe deeply. It’s important to celebrate this achievement. Use this moment to refocus and energize your team for the next stage of your business. But you’ll all too quickly get over this relief once you realize that you now need to grow the company considerably to raise your next round. The hard work of building a business continues.It's important to state here that I have seen rounds closed in a lot of different ways. There is no one size fits all approach. This guide is intended to offer some structure around the fundraising process and alleviate the uncertainty and anxiety founders experience. If there's one point I hope you take from this guide, in the words of Benjamin Franklin, \"By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.\"If you have questions about it, hit me up on Twitter.

Each week I tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out about work. Subscribe to get this newsletter weekly.Q: My co-founder and I are thinking about building a community around our product. Should we? And how do we get started?Community—so hot right now. Ask any founder if they’ve thought about building a community and 9 out of 10 times you’ll get an immediate yes. And for good reason. Companies like Atlassian, Glossier, Datadog, Twitch, dbt, Salesforce, Peloton, and many others have succeeded in large part due to the passionate community they built around their early products. A thriving community creates a sticky and evangelical user base, becomes a great source of ideas, and can even become a clever way to scale customer support (e.g. Airbnb):To guide you on your community-building journey (and even make sure it’s worth doing), I’ve invited David Spinks, the author of the book The Business of Belonging, a popular weekly newsletter for community builders, co-founder of CMX (a community of 30K+ community professionals), and VP of Community at Bevy (a conference and community events platform) to share his hard-fought wisdom with us. When I saw the first draft of this post, this was my response:Below, you’ll find a plug-and-play comprehensive guide to building your product community. Here’s what David has in store for you:1. Should you even be investing in community?Defining communityAligning community to business objectivesAligning community to your members’ goalsWho should own community?What to look for in a community hire2. What does a community strategy look like?The three levels of community strategyCreating community-level goalsCreating tactical-level goals3. How do you build a meaningful community?Designing community programsLaunching your online communityLaunching a community-led event programEnjoy!Community! It’s the talk of startupland these days.In the 2021 CMX Community Industry Report, 86% of companies said that “community is critical to [their] mission” and 69% of companies said that they “plan to increase their investment in community in the next year.”And according to First Round, even in 2019, 80% of startups were investing in community, and 28% considered it to be “their moat and critical to their success.”Through my work on CMX, Bevy, my podcast, and my book, I’ve had the opportunity to advise and learn from thousands of community teams small and large.This article takes many of the core lessons and frameworks from my work and applies them specifically to the needs of founders and startups who are just getting started with community.I’ll share some of the most common questions companies have about starting communities and give you actionable steps to get started. You’ll also be able to put the frameworks I share here into practice using A Founder’s Guide to Community Worksheet as you work your way through.1. Should we even be investing in community?Good! You’re starting with the right question. With “community” being so hot these days, companies are quick to launch communities without stopping to ask: Why?Community is a big investment, and it’s a very long-term commitment. It should not be taken lightly.Defining communityCommunity is more than just a feeling of belonging. In the context of business, it’s a structure for creating value. A simple way to understand it is to compare “community” to an “audience.”To build an audience, you help people.To build a community, you help people help each other.It’s a subtle but massive difference in mindset. Traditionally, businesses create all the value for the consumer. Community-driven businesses create spaces for consumers to create value for each other.Take Lenny’s Newsletter, for example. Lenny has built an incredible audience by creating valuable content that helps founders and product leaders. But Lenny saw an opportunity to scale the value he could provide to all of you by offering a community where members could support each other, and invited members of the community like me to contribute content. Now the amount of content and value that’s created isn’t limited by Lenny’s time and resources; it’s limited only by the motivation and ability of the community to contribute.Community unlocks the ability to scale value creation, with a relatively small team. It’s how Duolingo is able to run 2,600 events every month with a community team of three people. It’s how 83% of questions asked by Salesforce customers are answered by other customers. It’s how a subreddit with 155,000 members helps Notion users exchange ideas for how to be more successful with the product. They all empower their community members to contribute.There are lots of ways for members to contribute and take on leadership roles, including:Moderators: keep content clean and organized in the community Facilitators: start conversations in the community and host discussionsEvent organizers: start local chapters and self-organize local or virtual eventsAmbassadors: advocate on behalf of the brandContent contributors: write articles, create videos, or develop other forms of contentCommittee members: join a customer advisory board to guide product directionPower users: achieve status by being the most active members of a platformMentors: dedicate time to supporting other customers one on one or in small groupsBuilding community starts with creating a sense of belonging. That’s the baseline. But exponential growth happens when members start taking an active role.Aligning community to business objectivesThe next question is: Why should we build community? As with any investment, it’s important to understand the business goals before you start investing your time and resources. There are six objectives that a community can drive. To help businesses wrap their heads around the options, use the SPACES model:Support: Create spaces for customers to answer questions and solve problems for each other. Example: Autodesk support communityProduct: Create spaces for customers to share product feedback and ideas with each other and with your team. Example: Atlassian feedback sectionAcquisition: Build programs that help you grow your pipeline and customer base. Example: Branch’s Mobile Growth communityContribution: Enable members to contribute content, services, or something else of value to a platform you create. Example: Notion Template GalleryEngagement: Connect customers to each other around their common interests in order to increase customer retention. Example: Culture Amp’s Culture FirstSuccess: Enable customers to teach each other how to better use your product and be more successful in their careers. Example: Salesforce’s Trailblazer programEach objective comes with a different set of metrics that you’ll likely want to use to measure the business impact of the community:In my experience, the objective that startups focus on depends on their current stage.Pre-product-market-fit stageAt this stage, your goal is likely going to be around Product—collecting feedback and insights that will help you solve a clear problem for your customers. The added value of having a community is being able to share updates and collect feedback quickly from a group of your beta users in a shared space instead of asking them individually. They can respond to each other’s ideas and feedback. They can ask questions of you and of each other in a shared space, which can be easier than emailing you directly. And you can observe the organic conversations they’re having, which can bring up unique insights they wouldn’t have shared with you directly.Growth stageYour product is working, and your goal is to start growing your customer base. At this stage, companies’ community objective is usually Acquisition and Engagement. Your community can be a lead-gen source, bringing new prospects into your funnel. You may also start to identify early ambassadors who want to advocate for your product and refer new customers. Hosting events will reach new people on a local level, and empowering your members to self-organize events will reach regions you don’t have access to. Events and online communities will also deepen your customers’ connection to your product and brand, increasing retention and customer lifetime value.Maturity stageYou’ve already grown your customer base to the point where there’s an ongoing need to support them and help them better use your product. At this point, companies usually focus on Support and Success. Your community will allow your customers to answer questions and solve problems for each other, rather than your team needing to support all the customers yourself. You can also build educational communities where your customers can teach each other how to better use your product and help each other grow in their careers.Note: If your product is a platform like a marketplace, an open-source or crypto project, collaborative consumption, wikis, social networks, or anything else where the product itself is built or populated by users, then you’ll likely focus on Contribution from day one. Your product only works if you’re contributing, and building a community to engage and activate your most loyal contributors will be really important.Of course, with any community program, you get the added benefit of making customers feel a sense of belonging and connection, which should lead to increased loyalty and an all-around more meaningful experience with your brand. But that’s the icing on the cake. Focus on the tangible ROI that community will drive for your business when making the decision to invest. You’ll want to be able to say with confidence, and data, that community had a measurable impact on your business. Aligning community to your members’ goalsIt’s great that you have business goals, but if your members aren’t motivated to contribute to those objectives, your community program will fail. For example, if you want product feedback but people aren’t motivated to try your product and share their feedback with you, your community will be silent. Or if you want members to start organizing events but your members don’t have that motivation, there’s a misalignment that will result in failure.You have to talk to your potential members and identify their needs and motivations.It’s the simplest thing you can do to start building community today, yet it’s something that companies constantly skip over. Why? Because talking to people takes time and effort. It requires patience and a lot of listening. It can be emotionally taxing to get direct feedback. And it’s just more fun to brainstorm ideas and build things quickly.But make no mistake, the number one thing you can start doing today is talking to your members. It has the dual impact of building deeper relationships with members and giving you insights into how you can improve your product and community experiences. Email is OK, but it’s much better to talk live on the phone or in person. “Get out of the building,” as they say. Your customers are going to join your community because of benefits, not belonging. Belonging comes after someone has been a part of a community and formed relationships. What’s going to get them in the door in the first place is a clear understanding of how the community will help them solve a problem or achieve a goal. Those are the questions you should aim to answer in your member research.How to conduct user research about a potential community:Start a spreadsheet of the people that you’ll reach out to for an interview. Start with people that you already have relationships with, since they’ll be more likely to say yes to an interview. But also make sure you reach out to people you don’t know well but you think are a good potential fit for the community, as they’ll likely be more honest with you. Include criteria about them that will help you ensure you’re talking to a diverse group of people. That criteria could be: (1) roles—job titles, departments, company size, etc., and (2) demographics—race, sex, age, location, etc.Reach out to 10 of them to start, and ask for a 30-minute call. Take lots of notes, and pull out the two or three key insights that come from each conversation. After completing your interviews, reach back out to each member to thank them for their time and feedback. Share the key themes from your research with them and how it’s shaping the community plan. Ask them if you’re on the right track and if they’d be interested in being a founding member of the community.As you grow your community, make a habit of speaking with members regularly. Our team members all make a commitment to talk to at least one community member every week.The key questions to answer in your interviews (part 1 of the worksheet):Once you’ve done your research on what your business goals are and what your members’ needs are, you can rank each of the objectives and narrow it down to the one to three objectives you’ll focus on (I wouldn’t recommend going bigger than that). I also recommend accounting for how measurable each objective is for you right now, because if you can’t measure it, you’ll have no way of knowing if your community program is successful. Here’s an exercise you can do to help identify the business objectives for your community (part 2 of the worksheet):Rate each of the SPACES objectives by the following criteria:Business impact: How important is this objective to your business in the next 6-12 months? If you work under a specific department, how important is this objective to your department?Measurability: How easy will it be for you to access the data you need to measure this objective?Member motivation: To what extent do you believe your members will be motivated to participate in a program built for this specific objective?Then add the numbers up and put in your total rating in the last column to see which objectives are rated highest and, therefore, may be the most important ones for you to focus on.Who should own community?For startups, it’s really common for one of the founders to own community at the start. It makes sense—the founder wants to be as hands-on as possible to stay close to customers. And you may not have the funds to hire a full-time community lead.My recommendation is to start there, and look to hire a full-time community professional when the founder is no longer able to handle the workload and you have the resources to hire someone.That said, if you have the resources already because you’ve been bringing in revenue or you’ve raised funding, and you’ve decided that you want to take a community-led approach to achieving your goals, then you should hire a full-time community lead right away. It doesn’t mean that the founders won’t be involved in the community. On the contrary, it’s critical that everyone in the company sees community building as part of their role. And a great community lead will prioritize keeping the founders engaged in the community. They’ll also be able to start setting up the systems and processes to build and engage the community, measure it, and communicate updates to the entire team. A community professional’s job isn’t just engagement; it’s to build out the infrastructure that will make the entire community operation successful.Look at community like you would any other critical role in your business. Take product, for example. The founders often own product first and then hire a product expert to take the lead on operationalizing the product process. And if you hire a junior PM, you’ll have to provide them with a lot of guidance and training. If you hire a senior PM, you’ll feel more confident in handing it off, which will free up more time and brainspace for you. Community is the same. If you hire a junior community manager, they’ll bring lots of good energy and ideas, but they won’t have existing systems and processes from past experiences. You’ll have to provide them with that guidance or help them find it elsewhere. If you hire someone who has led community programs and teams before, you’ll be able to more readily hand off community operations to that person.What to look for in a community hireThe number one thing I recommend looking for in your first community hire is a genuine curiosity for the topic that your community is built around. They don’t have to have a lot of experience in the topic of the community. I’ve seen many community professionals be successful at leading communities of engineers when they themselves weren’t engineers. If they’re curious about the topic, it will make all of their interactions more authentic. Community members will sense their authenticity and will be more likely to engage with them.Some questions I like to ask when interviewing candidates for a Community Engagement Manager position are:Tell me about your background and why you’re interested in leading this community.We want to make sure that the person in this role has experience putting together an engagement plan for online community programs. Can you tell me about a time you worked on a problem like this?What separates good from exceptional when leading communities?What skills do you think are required to drive quality community engagement?Say we’ve been seeing a drop in engagement consistently over three months. What would you do to assess the situation and turn things around?What values are really important to you when it comes to the teams/companies that you work with?How would your current or past colleagues describe you as a leader?How would they describe an area that you could improve on?Keep in mind that community isn’t all about being a people person and driving engagement. A lot of community professionals function in more of an operational capacity. They work behind the scenes, creating systems and processes to make the community run more efficiently. And instead of engaging in the community directly, they may look to empower members of the community to take the lead on content creation. Some of the operational tasks that a community professional might take on:Managing analytics dashboards and reportingCreating processes for common community programs like running an event or recruiting new leadersOptimizing the community journey and new-member onboardingInternal communications Quarterly planningCreating automations to reduce repetitive tasksVetting and implementing new technology into the community stackWhen hiring your first community lead, spend some time considering what their tasks will be. Specifically, if you expect them to focus more on engagement, operations, or both. For a brand-new community, it’s likely you’ll want them to be primarily focused on engagement. For a community you’re ready to scale, you may want them to be more focused on operations.2. What does a community strategy look like?The three levels of community strategyOnce you’ve decided that you’d like to invest in community, you understand your business goals, and you’ve determined who will be responsible for running the community program, you’re ready to start mapping out your community strategy. Mazel tov! Your strategy should include three parts:Business-level goals—which we discussed in part 1Community-level goals—which we’ll discuss here in part 2Tactical goals—what you’ll do day-to-day to build community and drive business impactI recommend planning your community out on an annual, quarterly, and monthly basis. At CMX and Bevy, our community team uses objectives and key results (OKRs). At the end of every quarter, we review the past quarter’s results and set new OKRs for the upcoming quarter. These goals roll up into our business’s annual goals.I recommend planning to report on community progress every month. We send out a monthly CMX Report that updates the rest of our team on each of the three levels I listed above. Here’s an example of the table of contents from a recent report:Revisit your community strategy every quarter and set new community- and tactical-level goals. Try not to change it up too much within the quarter. At the least, your top-level business goals should remain the same unless there’s a big shift for the business.Creating community-level goalsBuilding on your business-level goals, the second level of your community strategy focuses on your community goals, and the programs you’ll run to achieve those goals. Programs are anything that you create to connect your members to each other. It can be an asynchronous space like a forum, Slack, Discord, or message board. Or it can be a synchronous experience like a meetup or conference.The idea is that by building successful community programs, you will drive business impact. It’s not always going to be direct causation, such that customers who participate in your community are spending more as a result. But companies will often do correlation analysis that show how members who participate in their community are more likely to buy the product, renew a contract, refer new customers, etc.At CMX, we focus on acquisition as our business goal and use specific actions in the community, like joining a space or attending an event, as a touchpoint in the sales journey. So at the end of each month and quarter, we can report how many leads and closed deals were sourced from community programs and how many were influenced by community programs. We don’t do this, but you could get more specific and look at activity rates in the community as a “touchpoint” to see how many people became a customer after, say, being active in the community for three straight months, or after becoming a top 10% contributor.For startups, and even for larger enterprises, this is probably overkill. Keep it simple. Are members in your community taking actions that are valuable to your business (buying, renewing, evangelizing, contributing, etc.)? If yes, then you’re good.You’re not going to be able to measure exactly how community health equates to business ROI. There are going to be a lot of things you do to build a healthy community that don’t have measurable ROI. But if your team is aligned on the belief that what’s good for your community is good for your business, and you’re measuring what you can measure, then you’re set up for success. If your company expects every single community action and program to have measurable ROI, then you have unrealistic expectations and you should step back.Once you’re aligned that community health is important, you can measure and report on the health of your community over time. To do that, I recommend measuring three things:Activity: Are your members participating regularly?Value: Are your members getting the benefits that they came for?Belonging: Do your members feel connected, safe, and included?For activity, a simple metric you can track is “% of total members who are active every month,” aka monthly active users (MAUs). Activity is often defined as logging in at least once in the past 30 days, but you can get more specific and look at comment and post rates as well.If you’re just kicking off a community for the first time and you’re curating a small group of founding members, this percentage should be very high, at least 50%. As your community grows, the percentage will naturally go down.For reference, the metrics for CMX community spaces today are:CMX Slack (4,200 members): 14% MAU (active is defined as posted, commented on, or reacted to a message or comment in a channel or DM)CMX Hub Facebook group (11,800 members): 18% MAU (active is defined as viewed, posted, commented, or reacted to anything in the FB group)If you want to go a little more in-depth, you can use what is called the stickiness score, which is DAU/MAU. Essentially it says: of the members who participated at least once in the past 30 days, here’s how many participated in one day. It speaks a little bit more concisely to the quality of contribution.In addition to your online community metrics, you should also track repeat attendance at your events.For value and belonging, you can answer these questions through interviews and surveys:For value, we use Net Promoter Score (NPS) as one measure of the value members get from the community that we can track over time. We’ll also ask two questions in surveys:What value do you expect to get from the community?On a scale of 1-10, to what extent do you feel you’re getting that value?Both NPS and the 1-10 rating give us a measurable way to track the value of our community over time.For belonging, we ask members to provide ratings (1-10) on questions like:Do you feel safe in the CMX community?Do you feel like your voice is heard?Have you formed relationships with other members of the community?Do you feel included?And we give them the option to share additional context on why they selected their ratings in a long-form answer, if they’d like to.We send out one large annual community health survey to all of our members, and a shorter health survey to every member 90 days after they join the community. Here’s how we run our annual survey process.Once you start collecting this data, you’ll be able to use it to inform future goals. You might focus on increasing MAUs by 10%, for example, or increase NPS by 5 points. Here’s a cheat sheet for measuring community health (also in our worksheet):Creating tactical-level goalsOn the third level of your community strategy, you’ll lay out all the specific things you plan to do in the upcoming month and quarter in order to improve community health and engagement and drive business impact.Examples of tactics could be:Host 3 educational eventsCreate a community member onboarding processWrite a set of community values and guidelinesPersonally message 10 passive members Post in the community every morningYou should assign goals to any tactic that you work on so that you can determine if it worked and therefore you should keep doing it, or if it didn’t work and you should cut it. It’s not always possible to measure every tactic, but do your best.For events, we send a survey after every event asking for NPS and asking members to share their experience at the event.For onboarding, you might look at new-member activation rates.For community values and guidelines, you can ask in your next survey if members are aware of the values and if they align with them.For personally messaging members, track to see if those members become more active after hearing from you.For posting in the community every morning, track the response rate to your posts to determine what’s resonating with the community.3. How do we build a meaningful community?Designing community programsBefore you kick off a new program, I recommend mapping out your community design so you can be intentional, rather than leave it to chance. After you launch a program, revisit your community design every three to six months to find opportunities to evolve the experience and keep things fresh.All community programs have some of the same fundamental elements, what we call the 7Ps of community:People: Who the program is focused onPurpose: Why they need this programPlace: Where members will gatherParticipation: What members will do Policy: Guidelines and rules that will shape the experiencePromotion: How members will learn about the programPerformance: What success looks like(You can fill out your own 7Ps of community in part 3 of the worksheet)Let’s look at an example of how the 7Ps are represented in an actual community program: TuesdaysTogether, a program run by the software company HoneyBook in which members of its community host a meetup on the second Tuesday of every month. At each event, creatives and entrepreneurs gather for coffee and conversation. Natalie Franke, the founder of Rising Tide, mapped out the 7Ps for these incredible community events:1. PeopleTuesdaysTogether meetups are gatherings for small-business owners who have a desire to share their knowledge, learn from their peers, and grow together. The events are organized by local industry leaders in the community and are focused on gathering creatives and entrepreneurs including artists, bloggers, boutique owners, calligraphers, designers, event planners, florists, makeup artists, photographers, stylists, wedding pros, writers, and more.2. Purpose We believe that getting out from behind your computer and building true relationships with other creative entrepreneurs is an incredible tool for success. By joining a TuesdaysTogether meetup, community members can expect to learn new business tips directly from their colleagues, grow in confidence, and find a network of compassionate professionals in their local area.3. Place Meetups occur on the second Tuesday of the month at local coffee shops.4. ParticipationMeetups will vary from city to city, and each leader has the freedom to cultivate gatherings that best fit their local area. However, most gatherings include a discussion on the topic of the month followed by an open question-and-answer segment. We encourage all attendees to not just attend and listen but to actively participate in the discussion.5. Policy Every meetup is designed to be approachable, authentic, and uplifting, and embody the five Rising Tide values:People come first.We go the extra mile.We love what we do. We are fearless. We are family.Leaders also agree to the Rising Tide community code of conduct and are expected to uphold the values and act in accordance with the Rising Tide mission in person and online. 6. Promotion Local leaders promote their events and grow their local communities over time by inviting members to their local Facebook group. 7. Performance A successful TuesdaysTogether meetup will receive positive reviews from attendees in a post-event survey.This is a brief example of a 7P design, and a full 7P plan can go into much more depth. But even briefly, you can see how designing for each of these elements can give you a more clear idea of what a space or experience will look and feel like and help you get clarity on the focus, intention, and expected outcomes of the space or experience.Each Rising Tide leader could use the 7Ps to get more specific in designing local events and experiences. They could use it for defining the key elements of local Facebook groups that the leaders use to keep their communities engaged in between events. Launching your online communityLaunching a community is a lot like hosting a party. You don’t want to invite everyone to your house and then get everything ready. You want to make sure everything is set up before people arrive, and host a pre-party so that when people arrive, the vibes are already flowing.Your community’s pre-party is extremely important, because when anyone joins the community, they’ll observe how people are interacting with each other and they’ll replicate it. Your pre-party is the mold for what your community culture will look like moving forward. And because it’s small, it will never be easier for you to shape that mold in the way you want. Once your community is big, it will be much harder to change directions. So start small. I’ll say it again: start small.The biggest mistake I see companies make when launching a community is going too big too fast. Not only do you miss out on the opportunity to shape the cultural mold, it’s also a worse experience for your community members. They’ll be one of many, instead of feeling like they’re part of a curated group of select members. They’ll be lost in the noise and overwhelmed by the rush of people and content. How small should you start? I’d recommend starting with 10 to 50 members. In the community world, the people you invite to the pre-party are commonly known as founding members. These are people who:Have a really clear need for the communityEmbody the values and culture you want to createAren’t so busy that they won’t be able to take an active role in starting the communityThese members are part of your founding team. They’re like the concentrate in your juice. Their job is to show up in the community before there’s a reason to, because no one is there yet. And they’ll do it because:They like to be early adopters, and take pride in being a founding memberThey see value in being connected to the other founding membersThey’re bought into the vision of the communityWhen we launched a private paid community for CMX back in 2017, we created a founding members group on Facebook to build the foundation of community before we migrated to a dedicated platform. We shared this overview with our founding members:Your ask of these community members is simple: seed quality content and conversations in the space, so that when you start to open it up to more people, the “vibes are already flowing.” New members will see the types of questions being asked, the quality of the answers, and the kinds of people who are participating, and they’ll replicate that example.Ask your founding members to post thoughtful questions in the community. Then message other founding members and ask them to jump in and answer those questions. Aim to get at least three quality answers per post. You can make it more structured by asking a member to do an Ask Me Anything (AMA) in the community where they get to be the expert, and it’ll generate a lot of quality content.You can also organize curated experiences for your founding members. Host a dinner or a private Zoom call. Engage them through live experiences that help them more deeply connect with each other and feel like they’re part of something special. You can start doing this before you even have a forum or message board for them to engage in.Tip: When you launch a new forum or message board, keep the number of channels or topics to a minimum. You may even want to start with just one “general” channel. This condenses engagement into one space and improves your ability to reach a critical mass of content and conversation in that space. Then, as the conversation grows, you can open up new channels and topics based on themes that you’re seeing in the general channel. Think about it like a party again. Say you’re opening up a club—you’ll want to keep everyone in one room so it feels full and then open up other rooms as the club fills in. If you have too much space for the initial group of people, it’ll feel empty.Have your founding members seed content and conversations in the space for one or two weeks, then start opening it up to more members. You should still take it slow, because you don’t want to overwhelm the existing community. I like using a 2x multiplier every two weeks: 10-> 20-> 40-> 80-> 160. Launching a community-led event programWhere companies are able to really scale their community is by empowering members of their community to self-organize events. Take Finimize, for example. Its team of three community professionals are leading a program where an event is hosted almost every day of the year. They’re able to run more than 200 events annually by empowering members of the community to host events under their brand.In addition to being able to scale quickly, it also personalizes the community experience for your members, since your hosts will more closely understand the needs of the communities they organize, either because it’s an in-person event and they understand the local culture, or it’s a virtual event and they focus on a specific topic.To kick off a program like this, start by hosting the events yourself. You want to find community-market fit for your events and ensure that the format and content is resonating with your members. You’ll know your events are working when they’re growing—you’re starting to see people come back to multiple events, and attendees rate the events very highly in your post-event surveys.Once you’ve identified an event format that works, turn it into a repeatable model that others can copy. You do this by creating a host playbook that maps out everything from:Community mission and valuesHow to launch a chapterHow to promote an eventHow to find a venueWhere to find design assets and resourcesHow to select speakersThe community code of conductAnything else that your hosts need to succeedJust like in your online community, I recommend starting small with three to five hosts so you can learn with them and ensure that the model works before you start scaling it up. Identify a few people who have already expressed an interest in hosting events, and give them permission to start organizing. Do this for three months or as long as you need to feel like the program is working.Create an application form for others to volunteer to host and share their information with you, so when you’re ready to scale, you have a list of volunteers ready to go. When you start opening it up, review the applications and set up interviews with everyone to ensure that they’re the right fit.It’s absolutely critical that you choose the right people to run these programs, since they’ll be representing your brand and community. Make sure they have the right motivations (genuinely care about helping others), are aligned on values, and understand the expectations you have of them. A common expectation you can set is that they host at least one event per quarter. Sometimes hosts can host an event every month, which is ideal, but you don’t want to set too high of expectations since they’re volunteering their time.Businesses usually reward these volunteers with swag, access to perks, invitations to exclusive events, speaker training, and other benefits. Some brands offer them a budget for their events, and some will compensate them too.The beauty of these programs is that once you nail the model, the sky’s the limit for how big you can scale it. Google has over 1,000 Google Developer Groups around the world, for example. You can power massive communities with a relatively small team with these sorts of distributed leadership programs. For a startup with limited resources, it’s a true competitive advantage.If you follow the playbook laid out here, a thriving community will start to form over time. There will be hard days. There will be days when engagement is low. Or worse, there will be days when members are upset and there’s negativity in the community.The key is to just keep showing up, keep talking to your members and making them feel heard, and keep on caring. Eventually your community will start to grow organically and you’ll be able to take more of an operational role, optimizing the system and making it easier for your members and leaders to contribute to the community. If you ever get stuck, you can always turn to your fellow members here in Lenny’s community, and of course the CMX community is packed with others who are building communities just like you.I’m also always happy to help.

Ask Patrick any question you have about pricing your product live!With that out of the way, let’s dive in!—How to price your SaaS productby Patrick CampbellPricing is one of those topics that sits at the nexus of uncomfortable and long-term, which means companies often don’t think about it for far too long. Even when they eventually figure it out, they don’t touch it again for years.The most successful companies optimize monetization in some manner every quarter. You may be thinking, “they change their price every 3 months!?” No, and that's the first lesson of monetization: pricing goes so much further than the actual price. Let me explain.If we go to a thirty thousand foot view, you have to think about what you're actually doing with pricing. No matter the business you're in — non-profit, retail, SaaS, DTC, B2B, whatever — you've created some sort of value. You attach a unit of measurement to the value you created: your price. Put simply, your price is the exchange rate on the value you're creating in the world.But price doesn’t live in a vacuum. Everything in your business — from sales and marketing to product and finance — is used to drive someone to buy the product at the price you're offering. Dozens of aspects of your business influence your price, and how effectively it converts customers:The segment and vertical you are targeting: You can go upmarket to customers who have higher willingness to pay, shift to a vertical that sees more value in your offering, or even change the ideal customer profile entirely.Your product, positioning, and packaging: You can come out with new features, move features to different tiers, pull features out and make them add-ons, change up your value propositions, etc.Your price: You can move your price up or down, which will impact conversion obviously, but will also impact the perception of your brand.These are not the only axes when it comes to pricing, but the point is anything that influences the value of your product is involved in pricing and monetization. Cool – I've now given you a college lecture worthy of a tweed blazer, so let's dig into where you should start.In the beginning, the actual number you're charging isn't that important. There are some exceptions, but for the most part, you should first be figuring out the range you're in: a $10 product, $100 product, $1k product, etc. Don't waste time debating $500 vs. $505, because this doesn't matter as much until you have a stronger foundation beneath you.What matters much more is two other questions:Your value metricYour ideal customer profiles and segmentsThese two elements are the foundation of your monetization and pricing strategy. Let’s explore them individually.Step 1: Determine your Value MetricA “value metric” is essentially what you charge for. For example: per seat, per 1,000 visits, per CPA, per GB used, per transaction, etc. If you get everything else wrong in pricing, but you get your value metric right, you'll do ok. It's that important. Partly because it bakes lower churn and higher expansion revenue into your monetization.Pricing based on a value metric (vs. a tiered monthly fee) is important because it allows you to make sure you're not charging a large customer the same as you'd charge a small customer.If you remember back to your high school or college economics class, the professor put a point on a demand curve for the perfect price and said “the revenue a firm gets is the area under that point.” The problem here is — what about all that other area under the curve? You’re missing out on that revenue by charging a flat monthly fee. “Good, better, best” pricing is a bit more advantageous, because you end up with three points on our trusty demand curve, and thus more revenue potential. You see this in a lot of retail products who are constrained by being physical goods — the car with the basic package vs. the car with the stereo and sunroof vs. the car with everything. In software, it’s thankfully dying out, but you’ll still see it with mass-market products:  Netflix, Adobe Creative Cloud, etc.A value metric however allows you to have essentially infinite price points — maximizing your revenue potential. In practice, you’ll never show infinite price points on your pricing page, sales deck, or mobile conversion page, but you may have a customer come in at a certain level and then grow.Value metrics also bake growth directly into how you charge because as usage or the amount of value received goes up (and those are not the same thing), the customer pays more. If they end up using or consuming less, they pay less (and thus avoid churning). This is why companies using value metrics are typically growing at double the rate with half the churn and 2x the expansion revenue when compared to companies that charge a flat fee or where the only difference between their pricing tiers are features. How to determine your value metricTo determine your value metric, think about the ideal essence of value for your product — what value are you directly providing your customer? In B2B, it's likely going to be money saved, revenue gained, time saved, etc. In DTC, it may be the joy you bring them, fitness achieved, increased efficiency, etc. Obviously, we can't measure all of these, but if you can, and your customer trusts your measurement (meaning you say you saved them $100 and they agree you saved them $100), that’s your value metric.As an example, the perfect value metric for ProfitWell Retain (our churn recovery product) is how much churn we recover for you. We can measure this, and our customers agree to the measurement, so we can charge on that axis. Other pure value metric products include MainStreet, which handles government paperwork to automatically get you back tax credits — you pay a percentage of the money saved. Most of you won't have a pure value metric, so the next step is to find a proxy for that metric. Take for example HubSpot’s marketing product. Their pure value metric is the amount of revenue their tool drives for your business. This is hard to measure and hard for the customer to agree to in terms of what percentage of credit HubSpot deserves for revenue from a blog post. Proxies for HubSpot are things like the number of contacts, number of visits, number of users, etc. To find the right proxy metric, you want to come up with 5-10 proxies and then talk to your customers and prospects. You’ll typically find 1-2 of these pricing metrics will be most preferred amongst your target customers. You then want to make sure those 1-2 also make sense from a growth perspective. Your larger customers should be using/getting more of the metric, whereas your smaller customers should be using/getting less of the metric. You also want to make sure the metric encourages retention.When we look at HubSpot, if they were to primarily price on “number of seats”, folks could share a login and HubSpot wouldn’t make much more money on large customers vs. small. Ironically they wouldn’t get as many people invested into HubSpot, because there’d be friction to adding additional seats. Instead, if they give unlimited seats and price based on “number of contacts” there’s minimal friction to getting as many people into HubSpot as possible to do activities (e.g. blog posts, email campaigns, landing pages, etc.) that then produce contacts.The result: HubSpot’s marketing product’s value metric is “contacts”, which ensures growth is baked directly into how they make money. The usage drives the metric, which therein drives revenue. Most importantly customers small, medium, and large are all paying at the point they see value and then can grow.Some other examples:Wistia charges by the number of videos or channels you use/haveZapier invented the concept of zap (connection of software) and charge based on time to connectTheater in Barcelona charged based on the number of laughsHusqvarna charges based on time for lawn care products vs. making you buy themRolls Royce charges per mile for airplane engines. They own the engines on the plane you own and do all the maintenance. Cool model.Fresh Patch charges based on the amount of grass you want per month for your dog — yes they deliver grass to you monthlyAs a side note, you should stop pricing based on seats for products where each seat doesn’t provide a unique experience. For instance, in a CRM if I log in to the AE sitting next to me’s account, I can’t really do my work because I’m only seeing their leads and accounts. Conversely, if I log in to our marketing manager’s account in HubSpot, I can do all the work I need. Thus, for the latter, seats is not the right value metric.Per seat pricing is a relic of the perpetual license era when we couldn’t measure usage or value enough within our products. We’re beyond that point, so use the above as a good litmus test. Step 2: Determine your customer profiles and segmentsThe second key component of your pricing strategy is determining your target segment and ideal customer profile. We've all heard about personas, and you may be rolling your eyes at the concept, but most personas are useless because they aren’t quantitative enough. When used properly, quantified personas and segments are beautiful tools. The information needs to go beyond just cute names like “Startup Steve,\" with a cute avatar, and cute meetings where people tell you they’re targeting \"developers\". To get quantified personas, you need to pull out a spreadsheet. Here’s a template you can use.1. Columns: Customer profiles you're targetingThese can take many forms, but the ultimate goal is to be as specific as possible so that you not only know who you’re targeting but how to monetize and retain them. Pragmatically, you typically separate these profiles based on size or role (or both). For example, a marketing automation product may target the following profiles: Marketing leaders (Director and higher) at companies $1M to $10MMarketing leaders (Director and higher) at companies $10.01M to $50MMarketing leaders (Director and higher) at companies $50.01M to $100MThe point is you can’t be everything to all people and you need to understand who you’re targeting in order to make better decisions. 2. Rows: Characteristics of each profile to help you differentiate between themMost valued featuresLeast valued featuresWillingness to payLifetime value (LTV)Customer acquisition costs (CAC)…and any other metric or category you think could be usefulIf you're just starting out or you don't have some of this data, it’s fine. Still fill it out though with your hypotheses. You know something about your customers.Next, you then need to validate (or invalidate) the most pressing hypothesis in that spreadsheet based on the decisions you’re going to make. If you're going to validate a new feature for a particular segment, then that's where you should start. Price point the biggest question? Start by researching the price point with each of these roles/segments.If you don't know who your key roles/segments are, there's no way in hell you’ll set up an efficient growth flywheel, let alone an optimized pricing strategy. Personas act as a constitution within your business to centralize your focus and arguments about direction.If you don't do segment and persona analysis, you better be able to raise a ton of money. I guarantee you there's some persona or segment on some vision document or in that euphoric part of your entrepreneurial brain that is completely wrong for your business. I see it all the time. Even I — someone who thinks about segments and customer research all the time — fall prey to being an absolute idiot with who we should target.When we built ProfitWell Metrics (our free subscription metrics tool) I thought we were geniuses who were going to be billionaires. Turns out analytics products are terrible. Willingness to pay for them is terrible; retention for them is terrible; NPS is terrible. Everything is just terrible, mainly because customers don't appreciate graphs or at least aren't willing to pay much for them. When we did our research this became obvious and put us 18 months ahead of our competitors, pushing us to change up the positioning of the product to freemium, which has fueled our business ever since (oh and our NPS is 70, because we massively over-deliver a free product better than the paid competition).Never underestimate the power of focusing on the customer through research. You should never, ever just do what they ask, but you need to be an anthropologist who knows them better than anyone else.Step 3: User research + experimentationBeyond your value metric and core segments, the monetization game becomes extremely tactical and research-based. Figuring out your price point involves researching those segments and then making decisions in the field. Same with discounting, add-on, and packaging strategies. The point: monetization is never finished because it’s the very essence of translating your value into an optimal framework for your target customer segments. Practically this is why you should be experimenting with your monetization every quarter. Experimentation can get tricky and have a few quirks, but you’ll find it’s similar to most growth frameworks out there (which are all versions of the scientific method). Here’s a good prioritization list of what you should attack in optimizing your monetization strategy once you have your core segments and value metric figured out: Priority 1: Foundational [See above]Core customer segmentsValue metricsPriority 2: CoreOrder of magnitude price point (are you a $10 product vs. a $500 product)Positioning and value propsPackagingPriority 3: OptimizationsAdd-on strategySpecific price point (are you a $10 product vs. a $11 product)Price localization/internationalizationDiscounting strategyContract Term optimizationPriority 4: Growth acceleratorsFreemiumMarket expansion (going up or down market)Vertical expansionMulti-ProductYour true order of operations with monetization will vary, but for the most part, all companies should work through the foundational and core sections before moving to the optimizations and growth accelerators. If you’re larger or there’s a fire, you may start with an optimization. In fact, this is sometimes a good idea. Something more scoped like “price localization” can help get momentum, be a forcing function to clean up tech and experimentation stacks, and mitigate political conversations. Remember, monetization is something that’s important, uncomfortable, and something you likely don’t know much about, so progress is better than nothing. Start small. You can (and should) always do more. Well, this is already longer than Lenny wanted, so I’m going to lean into the length with two last thoughts: I’ve included a rapid-fire of data that guides common monetization questions below.If you ever have a question about pricing or subscription benchmarks in general hit me up at patrick@profitwell.com or @Patticus on Twitter.🚨 Reminder: Patrick Campbell is doing a live AMA at 5pm PT 10/27 in our subscriber-only Slack group. Ask Patrick any question you have about pricing your product, live!Rapid-fire bonus advice ⚡1. You should localize your pricing to the currency and willingness to pay of the prospect's regionRevenue per customer is 30% higher when you just use the proper currency symbolHaving different price points in different regions increases revenue per customer further, and is justified based on different demand environments in different regions2. Freemium is an acquisition model, not a part of pricingThink of freemium as a premium e-book driving leads, not another pricing tierDon't do freemium until you truly understand how to convert leads to customers, because you’ll end up increasing noise or false positives when you’re trying to figure out your segment beachheads. The best folks who deploy free typically don’t implement freemium until 2-3 years into their business. The exceptions to this notion are if you have a very specific need or network effect (eg. marketplaces, social networks, etc.) or if you have a top 50 growth person on your team. To be clear, I'm not saying DON’T do freemium. I'm saying it's a scalpel, not a sledgehammer that requires thought. A lot of people end up reading our articles on freemium and end up going, “cool, let’s do freemium and we’ll be a unicorn.” I’m being pragmatic in that you need to realize freemium is fantastic, but doing freemium properly takes a lot of effort and nuance. Paid users who convert from free tend to have higher NPS, better retention, and much lower CAC.3. Value propositions matter oh so muchIn B2B value propositions can swing willingness to pay ±20%, in DTC it's ±15%4. Don't discount over 20%In some verticals discounting over 20% may be fine, but you're likely not in one of them (although you may think you are), but the size of the discount almost perfectly correlates with higher churn. Large discounts get people to convert, but they don't stick around.5. For upgrades to annual discounts don't use percentages and try offersPercentages don't work as well as whole dollar amounts for discounts (ie. \"1 month\" will work better than \"X percent off\"). Annuals see much lower churn rates.6. Should you end your price in 9s or 0s? Depends on your price pointEnding your prices in 9s evokes a discount brand, making the customer feel like they're getting something. Ending in 0 evokes luxury or premium. Studies on this for technology products is inconclusive. We have seen it increase conversion in lower priced products, but retention isn't as good with those customers.7. You should experiment with your pricing in some manner every quarterThis doesn't mean change the price point each quarter, but experiment with something. More changes correlates with increasing revenue per customer. Like all things, focusing on something makes you improve it.8. Case studies boost willingness to pay quite a bitSocial proof is important. Case studies can boost willingness to pay by 10-15% in both B2B and in DTC9. Design helps boost willingness to pay by 20%This graph didn't look this way 10 years ago when design didn't do much for willingness to pay. Today, affinity for a company's design can boost willingness to pay considerably.10. Integrations boost retention and willingness to payThe more integrations a customer is using, typically the higher their willingness to pay and the better their retention. I wouldn't charge for the integrations, but I'd use this as a tool to get people hooked in and paying more or buying different add-ons.Still here?

And how do I decide between offering a free trial or having a freemium product?Microsoft Teams came from behind and disrupted Slack’s dominance in workplace chat (145m DAU vs. 12m, respectively) by making its product essentially free (i.e. part of the Office 365 bundle). Robinhood launched the world’s first free stock-trading product and quickly built a waitlist of over a million people, completely disrupting the stock-trading space. And Fortnite generated over $5b just last year by giving its game away for free. Also, if you hadn’t noticed, freemium and PLG are all the rage these days.Free is the ultimate value prop. I’ve come across only three SaaS products that don’t have a free (or very cheap) offering. Why? Because free, used effectively, helps you (1) get people’s attention, and (2) gives people an incredibly low-friction (e.g. no sales call, no credit card) chance to take your product for a spin. The question isn’t really whether you should give away some or all of your product—you most certainly should. The question is what you should give away for free and how to most effectively use your free offering to drive top-line growth.Two ways to use free to your advantageMaking a product free isn’t a revenue, pricing, or monetization strategy—it’s an acquisition strategy. It’s always a means to lower CAC, increased virality, and a way to get people’s attention in a crowded market. All in an effort to monetize in some other way.There are two primary strategies for using free to drive growth:1. Business model disruption: Giving away the core product while making money in some other wayChime disrupted the entrenched banking industry by offering fee-free banking—while making money through transaction interchange fees. Robinhood broke out by launching free stock trading—while making money through payment for order flow. Square gave away free PoS systems—as a wedge into taking a cut of SMB transaction flows (and later, lending, banking, payroll, and much more). Making their products free gave these companies a way to break through the noise.“If it’s digital, sooner or later it’s going to be free.”—Chris Anderson, Free: The Future of a Radical PriceFind a way to make free a product that is currently not free, and you’ll get a lot of people’s attention.2. Lead gen: Give prospects a taste of your product (freemium or trial) in hopes that they take a full biteThe more typical way to use free to drive growth is to give potential customers a way to try your product (or parts of your product) for free. This is done with a free trial or a free tier of your product. The bet is that the lower friction of trying out your product leads to more paying customers. As you’ll see below, nearly every SaaS product goes this route.“I have never come across the business where I don’t believe there’s not a role for free at some point in their strategy.”—Elena VernaFind a way to make (part of) your product free, and you’ll most certainly accelerate growth.For the purpose of this post, I’m going to stick to typical free strategies for SaaS  companies, but there are other ways to use “free” to drive growth:Free samples (e.g. Red Bull)Free shipping (e.g. Amazon Prime)Free prize inside (e.g. cereal boxes)Getting a bonus for signing up (e.g. Uber)When to go trial vs. freemiumI looked at the pricing models of about 50 SaaS products, and the takeaways are fascinating."},{"title":"The top 5 things PMs should know about engineering","article":"👋 Hey, Lenny here! Welcome to the ✨ bonus free edition ✨ of my weekly newsletter.

Also, with the rise of Web3, fintech, data infrastructure companies, and other deeply technical products, it’s only becoming more important for PMs to build their technical chops.To help you develop those chops, I’ve pulled in Justin Gage, author of the fantastic Technically newsletter (fittingly described as “a place for not software engineers to learn about software engineering”), to share his highly actionable tips on becoming a more technical PM. In my previous post on the subject, I linked to Justin’s newsletter numerous times, and that’s because he’s especially talented at explaining deeply technical subjects clearly and directly. We’re super-lucky to have Justin share his wisdom with us. And if you want to go deeper, definitely subscribe to Technically.The top 5 things PMs should know about engineeringby Justin GageThere’s an old debate about how technically minded product managers should be. On the one hand, understanding your developers, their process, and their work is part and parcel of shipping products effectively. On the other hand, you don’t want to step on your engineers’ toes, and getting too deep into the codebase isn’t a great use of your time. One point we can all agree on, though: a strong technical knowledge foundation means a more effective PM. So in that spirit, this post will cover the top five technical things PMs should know.If you don’t understand some of the ideas here, that’s fine! The more you work with engineers, the more comfortable you’ll get. And of course, every company is different; some companies hire only super-technical PMs, while others prefer generalists, or even design-focused ones. But no matter what, the more you understand, the better you’ll do.Learn #1: Your company’s tech stackWhat to know: What technologies your company’s app, site, and infrastructure use. For example, Technically.dev is built with React and Next.js, deployed on Vercel, and written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.Data from StackshareWhy it matters: Choices of programming languages, frameworks, and infrastructure all come with important trade-offs that impact what might make a project something that could take a few hours, or a few weeks. If you’re using a NoSQL database, you can skip migrations when adding new features, but you might run into data quality issues. If parts of the stack are legacy, you may want to avoid projects that touch them. But perhaps more qualitatively, speaking the language of your engineers helps build trust and improves communication.How to learn about it: Do as much snooping as you can, and then just ask your team. First, look at your company’s GitHub repositories. You should be able to see what kinds of programming languages are in there, as well as any files or notes specific to what frameworks the app relies on. Here’s a screenshot of Supabase’s main repo, an open source Firebase competitor. Note how GitHub tells you what languages the code is in (on the bottom right):Beyond languages, the structure of your team’s project might indicate what frameworks they’re using. If you see some files prepended with .next, your team is probably using NextJS. If you see “import { useState } from ‘React’ ” in any files, your team is probably using React. Reading through code files isn’t too fun and is not the best use of your time, but peeping at a few can at least give you some grounding.After you’ve done your snooping work to impress them, just ask one of your developers.Learn #2: Sensitive points in the codebaseWhat to know: Which pieces of the codebase—logical or procedural—are tangled, sensitive, or otherwise intransigent. Why it matters: Knowing the hardest parts of the app to work on can help you plan more effectively and avoid project delays. If updating the marketing site copy takes a few days because Gatsby (a popular JS framework) requires a re-deploy to change content, you might de-prioritize that work in favor of something that you can move on quicker. There might not be much you can do about this as a PM, but it’s useful knowledge to have and can help you allocate resources more effectively.How to learn about it: Talk to fellow PMs about projects that went surprisingly quickly or surprisingly slowly. A personal example: after doing some work on improving the onboarding experience, I was frustrated with how long things were taking. I eventually learned that the section of our codebase that dealt with onboarding was poorly organized and very difficult to test locally. That explained it! And of course, ask your engineers; they’ll know better than anyone.Learn #3: Your build and deploy processWhat to know: How your app gets built and deployed to your users, what’s manual and what’s automated, and how long it usually takes.Why it matters: Writing code is only half the battle—you need to get it to your users by deploying the changes to production. Larger teams and more complex apps can have multi-day deployment processes that may delay projects and add to lead time. Knowing these pressure points can also help you more effectively batch features and understand what’s worth doing when.A good example is how your company distributes cloud builds vs. on-premise builds. If it takes a while to get newer versions of your software to your on-premise customers, as a PM, you might try to batch a few features on a tighter timeline so that your team can bundle them together for a single release. For small updates like copy changes, you might feel comfortable doing them yourself if the release process is easy, but may time them along with another PM’s release if deploys take longer.How to learn about it: Ask your developers, but you can also do some legwork before then by looking at pull requests (PRs) that have been merged and what the GitHub checks (or whatever else your version control system is) run for builds. Here’s an example from Supabase; it looks like the team is using Vercel to deploy the app, since the Vercel bot commented on the PR with links to deploy previews. This is good to know—after doing some digging on Vercel, you might navigate to its site and learn that its product makes deploys quick and easy, usually sub-5 minutes. That information may come in handy later on when you’re wondering if you can get that copy change in before the deadline, or if asking your engineer for a quick change is going to be too bothersome. To find open PRs on your team’s repositories in GitHub, just navigate to the repository, click on the “Pull Requests” tab, and click on any one.If your app also has customers that deploy it on-premise, you’ll want to get information on how upgrades work (do customers get them automatically? how often does the team recommend updating?), how far behind cloud they are, and how difficult one-off builds are.Learn #4: How to contribute codeWhat to know: How to make code changes and open a PR, specifically for small, self-contained changes like updating copy or changing colors.Why it matters: Great products have great copy, and you shouldn’t have to rely on your engineers to fix typos. Being able to make small changes yourself, be it copy or fixing an errant border radius (generally frontend stuff), will result in more polished products shipped faster. Don’t bite off more than you can chew, though; keeping the code you contribute to smaller copy- or design-related tweaks will win you points.How to learn about it: As you get started, sit down with your favorite engineer on your team and ask them to walk you through how to contribute code. It’s going to look something like cloning your app’s repository locally, running it locally, making a fix and committing your changes, and then opening a PR in GitHub. You can even cheat and edit some code directly in GitHub, as long as it’s low-risk (like this markdown file):Learning how to code is obviously beyond the scope of this post. Personally, I got my start by studying some slides from a Python class in college (that I wasn’t taking), brushed up with Codecademy, and then ended up building full-stack apps in my free time over the course of my career. If your goal is to be dangerous, focus on your team’s primary programming language and set a reasonable goal with a developer. Maybe it’s updating the copy on the website or something simple. The hardest part tends to not be the code itself but rather the process around the code, like handling version control and CI (continuous integration).Learn #5: Technical basics 101What to know: Outside of your company’s codebase, you need a basic understanding of how apps, data, and infrastructure work. Beyond being able to code, a conceptual understanding of what pieces come together to build applications is table stakes.Why it matters: A lot of what your developers tell you will sound like complete nonsense without the right technical foundation. And whether you know how to code or not, you’ll want to know what your developer means when they say they can keep this feature to a “frontend change only.” How to learn about it: There’s no teacher as valuable as experience. The reality is that knowing how to code—specifically, how to build apps that relate to your company’s stack—is the best way to be more technically literate. But that takes a long time, and simply isn’t for everyone! Thankfully, there are some shortcuts you can take in the meantime. A few that have worked for me:1. Read engineering blogs They’re sometimes surprisingly easy to understand, and can get you used to the terms engineers use daily. I like reading Segment’s, Slack’s, Netflix’s, and Stitch Fix’s. Teams usually write these for recruiting purposes—look at all the cool stuff we’ve built!—but they can still contain useful base knowledge. Much of being technically literate is understanding how software is used in practice, and these blogs are great for that.  2. Look up everything you don’t knowTechnical writing and speak is built on layers and layers of concepts; you need to start from the bottom to understand the top. Search for terms you don’t understand rather than just glossing over them. There aren’t very many good central resources online for going from 0 to 1 in being technically literate, but many individual concepts have useful explainers. A nice example is Duo Security’s guide to SAML. Search enough and, with a discerning eye, you’ll find writing styles you like.3. Find a developer friend on the outsideChances are you’re friends with a developer outside your company; buy them a coffee! Come with some questions prepared. It’s usually unproductive to have them dump their knowledge on you, but a series of pointed questions around a particular topic can lead to a fruitful conversation. For example, when I’m writing newsletter issues, sometimes I’ll grab 30 minutes with an engineer friend to make sure I fully understand a topic I’m writing about. Doing your research beforehand to make sure you have good questions is the key.Aside from these, though, subscribe to Technically—it’s made for exactly you :)Thanks, Justin!🔥 Featured job openingsMynd: Product Manager, Buying Services (Remote-US)OpenPhone: Senior Product Manager (Remote-US)TaxBit: Product Lead (Seattle)Orbiit: Director of Product Management (NYC)Relish Works: Associate Product Manager (Remote-US)OnFrontiers: UI/UX Designer (Remote-US)OnFrontiers: Product Manager (Remote-US)Panther: Product Manager (Core) (Remote-Global)The.com: Software Engineer (SF)Relive: Product Manager (Remote-EU)GetSetUp: Product Lead, Discovery (Remote-Global)Browse more open roles, or add your own, at Lenny’s Job Board.How would you rate this week's newsletter? 🤔Legend • Great • Good • OK • MehIf you’re finding this newsletter valuable, consider sharing it with friends, or subscribing if you haven’t already.SubscribeSincerely,Lenny 👋"},{"title":"The Transition: Layering sales onto a bottom-up self-serve product","article":"👋 Hello, I’m Lenny and welcome to a ✨ once-a-month-free-edition ✨ of my newsletter. Each week I humbly tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing them out at the office.If you’re not a paid subscriber, here’s what you missed this month:Magical growth loopsHow to manage upStartup PM vs. big company PMSubscribeQ: I have a self-serve bottom-up SaaS product, and I'm trying to decide if, when, and how I should hire my first full-time salesperson.One of the most surprising takeaways from my research into early B2B growth was that 100% of the bottom-up B2B companies ended up layering on a sales team. It’s rarely a question of if — it’s a question of when, and how.Since I don’t have a lot of depth in sales myself, I went straight to my go-to person for all things sales: Pete Kazanjy. If you don’t know of Pete, he wrote THE book on startup sales, which he recently released as a physical book. This tweet was not an exaggeration:Pete generously agreed to write a guest post, and unsurprisingly, below you’ll find the most in-depth and tactical guide for adding sales into your org. Including:Should I start with a self-serve product?Should I ever involve salespeople?When should I add a salesperson to the mix?How do I set myself up for success during The Transition?Common pitfalls to avoidLet’s dive in!A bit more about Pete: In addition to authoring Founding Sales, Pete Kazanjy is also the founder of Atrium, makers of data-driven management software for sales teams, and founder of Modern Sales (the world’s largest peer-education community for sales operations and leadership professionals). He previously started and sold TalentBin (a recruiting software startup) to Monster Worldwide. You can find him on Twitter and LinkedIn.The Transition: Layering Sales onto a Bottom-Up Self-Serve ProductBy Pete Kazanjy“Bottom-up” (or “product-led”) B2B growth is a hot topic in early-stage circles these days, and it makes sense why. A self-serve (“easy-in”) entry motion, that’s later combined with a strong direct sales motion, can make for explosive revenue growth as shown by IPO’d exemplars Zoom, Slack, Datadog, and private market dynamos like Airtable, Figma, and others. The combination of bottom-up self-serve plus direct sales can simultaneously lower CACs and power larger contract values (with expansion into enterprise contracts). This would never be possible in a pure self-serve model.The crux of this article is that waiting too long to add sales-involvement often leads to a large opportunity cost. Many successful self-serve applications saw their market position usurped by competitors who adopted a sales-assisted motion and effectively firewalled the self-serve-only products out of lucrative enterprise segments (e.g. Dropbox).Below, I’ll help you understand if layering in sales is right for your business, when to take the leap, and how to navigate this critical transition successfully:First of all, should I even start with a self-serve product?Self-serve has a lot going for it, but it’s not necessarily a slam dunk decision for every product. Below are four questions to take into consideration before building a self-serve product (many of which can be answered before you launch):1. Is the product simple enough for self-serve? Successful self-service is about allowing a user to get to success and have that “aha” activation moment on their own. So the question that follows from this is how easy is it for users to get to that aha moment? Zoom is not complicated. Send someone a link or join someone’s link, and boom, you’re talking to them. Dropbox is pretty straight forward – download this client, and tell it what folders to sync. Airtable is a bit more advanced, but you can start simple, and they’ve invested heavily in a content catalog of templates and recipes to allow for self-served advancement.Note, “complexity” is audience contingent. Tableau is not an easy product to use by any stretch of the imagination, but it’s self-serviceable by the technical data analysts for whom it was designed, and as such started self-serve with a desktop client download. Similarly, Stripe, Datadog, Twilio, New Relic, and other developer tools have all started self-serve, in that their technical audience has the capacity to self-serve even these more involved products. Some offerings are really just too complex to start self-serve, such as enterprise-grade marketing automation platforms like Marketo,  and software targeting massive financial enterprises like Blend.2. Is this truly new and differentiated? If your offering is truly new and differentiated, self-serve can be fantastic. When Yesware and Mixmax first launched, most organizations didn’t have any sort of sales engagement email offerings for their salespeople. The notion of sending someone a link to a public calendar with which to book time was crazy talk when Calendly first launched. Software that proactively monitors your revenue stack’s automations and linkages for errors has never existed, which is why Sonar can be self-serviced by sales and marketing operations staff. Personal business cloud app search has never existed before, and thus there’s no reason for a given user in an organization to not download and give Command E a try.3. Can this co-exist with a (less good) incumbent in a given company’s stack?Conversely, if your offering can coexist alongside inferior incumbents, self-serve can also work. Most organizations where Slack was adopted early-on already had Gmail and thus GChat. Organizations that start using Guru may have antiquated knowledge bases in Sharepoint or in Confluence wikis. This is where my company, Atrium lives. Customers will frequently have legacy analytics infrastructure, like Tableau or Looker, in place, but its complexity underserves the needs of the sales organization, leaving open an opportunity for Atrium to enable data-driven management for sales managers and sales operations staff in a way they’re currently not doing. Tableau and Looker still end up existing in the organization, but for more advanced analytics run by a data or analytics team.By contrast, an “end to end” offering like a Human Resource Information System (e.g. Workday) or email sending platforms (e.g. Iterable) are not something you have “two of” in an organization. As such, even though Sapling makes delightful modern HRIS software, they don’t have a self-serve offering. Iterable makes great, modern customer engagement software, but it’s highly unlikely an organization would run a legacy system like Responsys and Iterable side by side. Self-serve would likely not work for them. 4. Will you focus on small organizations?If none of the above apply, you can still target smaller orgs that have not yet adopted a legacy provider with a self-service offering. Stripe is a great example here. Payments providers already existed when Stripe first came on the scene, so it was less likely for a mature e-commerce provider with an existing payments provider to switch to a new upstart. But because legacy providers were clunky with poorly documented APIs, Stripe was the obvious choice for new internet businesses who didn’t yet have a payments provider.RevOps makes fantastic quoting software for sales organizations that can be self-setup, but there’s no way anyone who already has Salesforce CPQ or Apttus is going to switch over to them. But for a 10 person sales organization that wants to systemize the creation of quotes and sending proposals, the idea of solving that problem in less than 5 minutes (rather than 3 months, like a standard Salesforce CPQ deployment) is really attractive. Which is why self-serve works for RevOps, specifically targeting this down-market segment.Should I ever involve salespeople? Once you’ve determined whether self-serve is right for you, growth is going well, and you’re on your merry way (i.e. people are self-serving, getting to “aha”, transacting, and retaining), the next question would be “OK, well, should we get some salespeople involved here?” Well, that depends.There are two primary reasons to add salespeople to a self-serve commercial motion:To facilitate the penetration or expansion of your solution into an organization where it has an initial foothold, and/or To help raise conversion rates of your self-serve offer It turns out, humans are really helpful when it comes to smoothing over weird edge cases, communicating complicated concepts, and persuading other people to surmount their inertia and try a new thing. They’re good at, you know, selling! But there’s a downside. Humans are expensive, and can only do so many tasks in a given amount of time - as compared to software which, once written, is really cheap to run, and can be scaled up to do as many tasks as you like. So the question of “should I add sales to the mix?” is one of “will it help?” and “will the juice be worth the squeeze?”1. Facilitating the penetration or expansion into an organizationThis is the approach Slack and Zoom’s early sales motions helped with. It wasn’t about a salesperson showing up to an organization and saying “Hi, you need intra-organizational communication assistance, you should check out Slack.” Rather, teams within organizations might start using Slack to communicate amongst themselves, and the addition of an “Account Manager” (psssst...it’s a salesperson) helped unify those various pods into a single contract, while potentially adding more pods, was powerful. Similarly, in a more “single-player” offering, like Command E, a handful of sales people in a 200 person sales organization might start using it to search their Salesforce opportunities, their Google Docs, and their Gmail, but a “Customer Success Specialist” (psssst...it’s a salesperson) offering to “give a personalized tour to the rest of the sales organization” could also be quite powerful (for expansion).2. Helping with conversionSometimes even supposedly simplistic offerings can have sharp edges or places where a user can get hung up on their way to an “aha” moment. This is another place where “sales” people can be helpful. I use the quotes because this frequently looks more like support and customer success than it looks like sales, but the goal is the same: get the user to success so they can transact. Much of this will be addressed by product or marketing approaches via programmatic email, in-product guides, and so on, but in cases where you might know it’s worth it to engage the user to assist with their conversion, having dedicated people to do so can be helpful.How do you know it’s worth it? Imagine a situation where the average user of your software ends up spending $5,000 a year. And further imagine you know that engaging with a hung, unactivated user doubles the probability they convert to a customer from 10% to 20%. Lastly, you know that the time cost of doing so is a couple of hours, by a staff resource that costs $50 an hour. With those inputs, we’re essentially saying “I can spend $100 in human labor to capture $500 in expected conversion upside.” In this case, it seems it might make sense to have a “sales assist” salesperson. That said, Snowflake’s probably not going to be sales-assisting every abandoned user who signs up for an account and bails. If you can differentiate between the valuable hung users and everyone else, this can work. For example, if early Slack sees that a Director of IT from, say, Tesla had signed up for a Slack account, and abandoned their instance before inviting anyone else or setting up channels...well, I have a hunch that it might be worth a person’s time to engage with that user, by phone, by email, maybe even by candygram to see if we can get them to success. This is what is often known as a “qualified” or “gold” lead that, in this case, has been generated by your product.This realm is where my company, Atrium, sits. Because it takes less than 90 seconds to sign up and stand up a sales performance analytics harness, we get a lot of people “checking it out.” Because our average sales price is high enough (in the many thousands of dollars), it’s very much worth our while for a salesperson to engage with abandoned users who fit the criteria of a potentially successful customer - which, amongst other reasons, is why we have a sales team full of delightful, helpful humans to do just that. For more on how to differentiate between an ideal customer who’s “worth the time” and those that aren’t, check out this section of Founding Sales on the topic.The other thing to consider is something I call “commercial conversion”. You might not have issues with users getting to product value, but there could be other barriers to successful conversion. Security audits, sign-off from the procurement team, you name it. This is another reason why having humans involved can be helpful – a head of data infrastructure that wants to take Snowflake off her credit card, and get procurement to start paying via invoicing may need some hand-holding. Providing that can be in your best interest, along with an easy means by which to “Contact Sales” on your home page and in your product to facilitate that.All that said, you have to make sure the economics pencil out. Humans are not cheap, so you need to make sure that the added human labor costs are worth the enhanced revenue upside. Generally speaking, you want to see a salesperson delivering 4x their fully loaded cost in incremental revenue. So make sure to do the math on how many of these unique potential transactions (“opportunities” in sales speak) a given sales rep can handle in a given time period and what the value output might be. For example, let’s say it takes on average two 30-minute meetings per opportunity (both wins and losses), a rep can have 20 of these meetings a week, thus 80 per month, giving you a 40 opportunity “budget” per rep per month. Let’s say this capacity costs us, say, $10k in salary expense and commission for a junior AE - meaning a cost of $250 per opportunity managed. If we get $5k out of each successfully won opportunity, and win 25% of those engaged - well, that’s 10 wins out of 40 monthly attempts, for $50k of revenue, on a sales rep cost of $10k. Not bad! We should test this out! You can use this rudimentary SaaS Sales Staffing Model to play around with what this could look like for your offering.You have to at least have a credible hypothesis that this could commercially work for your offering before engaging wholeheartedly in the effort (or, testing it, meaningfully.). By contrast, if you do the above math and it feels more like you’d be getting $20k of bookings out of a $10k of rep costs...sales assistance may not be in the cards for you. Unless you can raise your prices, lower the costs of your reps, raise your win rates, or substantially increase the number of opportunities a given rep can handle in a time period.Some organizations push the envelope here by locating lower-end salespeople offshore. Take KeepTruckin, makers of Fleet Management Software. They have an expansive SMB sales team in Pakistan, where the cost of a salesperson is much, much lower than in the United States, who are charged with handling smaller opportunities from US-based mom and pop trucking companies with one, two, or three trucks (KeepTruckin’ also has a US-based sales team in Nashville for managing larger prospects). They get the benefit of higher human-assisted conversion while keeping their costs lower.When should I add a salesperson to the mix? Assuming that you’ve decided you meet the criteria above, and believe you will benefit from involving people in your sales motion, the next question becomes when to start doing so.The good news is there are pretty helpful signals to indicate that now is a good time to start. First, make sure that you have a “Contact Us” or “Contact Sales” call to action on your home page in a place that wouldn't distract the user from self-sign up, but at least discoverable enough such that if someone was looking for it, they could easily find it.This is how you’ll start to see if you get inbound requests asking for help with “commercial conversion.” Like “Hey, finance would like us to put this on an invoicing relationship” or “What’s your SOC 2 situation?” or “We have a couple of different teams that we need to consolidate into one billing relationship.” As you start seeing more of these come in, maybe one or two a week, now’s probably the time to dedicate someone to handling those – a salesperson!Now, obviously one or two inquiries a week isn’t exactly a full-time job, but it’s an indication that there are likely recurring needs like this in your existing customer base. For each user who raises their hand for help, there are probably ten other users who have the same pain point. So once you have that person in seat, handling those inbound inquiries, they can also start going outbound (“warm outbound”, versus pure cold outbound) into the customer base to determine if they can proactively help with some of these issues (and, perhaps, expand your offering within the customer’s account).Having someone handling these requests is almost a two-for-one: Inbound inquiries help indicate that you need someone helping with commercial transactions, and their extra bandwidth (to start) can be used to start proactively engaging customers where your solution has an initial foothold to further penetrate the organization. For example, if Command E is seeing that a handful of salespeople are using the tool in a 200 person sales org, and then proactively engaging with those users (plus others) to see if they can do some personalized demonstration could help the rest of the sales org.The second case for involving sales – raising conversion rates for accounts that are “worth it” – is a little trickier. If you’re like RevOps, and the cost of the software is such that it’s worth engaging pretty much any qualified user signup that abandoned, well, you would start doing this from day one. If you’re more in the realm of a Snowflake, Datadog, Mixmax, and others, where you can have individuals signing up for $99 a month, who would happy to stay at that level forever, mixed in with people signing up who may be starting at $99 a month but could represent an organization who could scale up to tens of thousands of dollars a month, well, we have to figure out a way of differentiating between these groups. The good news is that you may already be getting low-tech indications that there could be a place for sales via the “Contact Us” information above. If Lockheed, Boeing, and General Motors all have registered a Contact Us request...well, that’s probably a good bet that Airbus, Ford, and Tesla have started a signup flow and abandoned. If this is the case, it’s probably time for us to get more proactive about knowing when a highly qualified lead comes through signup. I talk about this in the Early Inbound Marketing chapter of Founding Sales. There are a few ways to approach this. One way is to add some fields to your initial signup form that helps characterize the potential value of an account. For example, Snowflake asks for a user’s Title and Company name on signup, which can be used to make a judgment about the potential value of the user signing up (“Software Engineer” vs. “Director of Data Infrastructure''). Datadog, on the other hand, doesn’t ask for the user’s title, but does ask for a Company name, and also ask for a Phone number - even though it’s not required (some people want you to call them! I promise!).With this information in hand, we can do some smart things. Even something as basic as pinging an internal email listserv or Slack channel with new signups, so a person can see them makes a big difference. Later, you can get more advanced with programmatically sorting new signups based on observable factors (title, company size) and behavioral factors (if they completed the signup or abandoned it) to quickly differentiate between needles and haystack, and focus in on the needles - the “Directors of Data Infrastructure” from Tesla, while letting the lower value intensity signups be handled by our “tech touch” maturation efforts (emails, in-app messaging, etc.). The even more advanced version of the above is using form enrichment from providers like Clearbit to match a signup email to a composite profile associated with that email address, and thereby potentially not have to ask, or, allow us to add additional information (e.g., company size) without having to extend our form, and thereby injure our conversion rates.How do I set myself up for success during the transition?Once you’ve decided the time is right to add salespeople to assist your self-serve product, there are a few key items to ensure you get it right. First, figure out if the initial focus of this salesperson will be:“Scooping up” pods of successfully activated customers in large organizations and facilitating expansion in those accounts, OR Helping with the conversion of unactivated customers. Your initial focus is likely determined by the same information that told you it was time to start involving sales. If you’re, say, Zapier, and you keep seeing duplicate instances showing up in larger organizations, you might focus on the “scooping up and expanding” motion. Alternatively, if you’re Datadog, and you see registrations from really compelling logos showing up in the signup logs, but never turning on data flows, you might focus on the “help with conversion” motion. This isn’t to say that you can’t have both motions concurrently, but given that you should be approaching this as an experiment to start, better to focus on one, get that right to start, before moving on to validate the other.First, do it yourselfOne key part of starting things off right is to prototype this sales motion yourself, as the founder or product manager. This is something I talk about quite a bit in my book on sales for founders. As a foremost expert in the problem space you’re addressing, you’re best positioned to have the first few dozen of these sales conversations. In part, this is because you know way more about the market and the product than any salesperson you will hire, and secondarily, as you start adding a human element to your sales motion, you will invariably quickly discover new product requirements. Given that product requirement gathering is typically best done by a business founder initially, or someone who works on the product like a product manager, it’s best to have those people having these initial conversations. Later on, these sales tasks will be handed to a specially hired salesperson but usually only after the initial motion has been at least roughed out. Provide data insights for salesThe next thing you’ll need is the insights to do sales well. Which means at least basic analytics. If you’re focusing on “scooping up pods” and expanding into organizations, then analytics or alerting that notifies you, proactively, to the fact that a larger organization has multiple successful instances of your offering deployed will be key. Note there are two things here - one is being able to see where there are multiple instances, and the second is the ability to see success, as indicated by heavy usage and feature adoption. Similarly, understanding which of your successfully deployed customers are situated in much larger organizations could be fertile ground for expansion and thus help you prioritize which of these pods you’d like to go after first. Sometimes this can be intrinsic to your product. Most users of Command E sign-in with Google Apps to allow the product to index their GDrive and Gmail. What’s neat is that with this API access, Command E can also query how large that user’s larger organization is. Bigger organizations mean potentially more Command E users, and thus perhaps a juicy target to engage for expansion. When someone turns on Sonar to instrument their Salesforce instance, Sonar can quickly see how many total users are in that Salesforce instance, how many of them have admin rights (typically correlated with the number of eventual Sonar users), and how many tricky automations are already built in that Salesforce instance, which is correlated to the amount of value Sonar offers to a customer. If you can’t get this data intrinsically from your product, then it’s definitely worthwhile to do some basic enrichment work via APIs like Clearbit. First, consider removing the ability for a user to sign up with a personal email address (or, at least making it non-default and higher friction) to help with your enrichment efforts. Even just having eyes on a domain can help you prioritize which accounts would be best to engage with. Second, enrichment providers can give you the size of the organization that a given user is associated with in their database. Bigger organizations are typically better when it comes to proliferating a successfully “landed” self-serve customer to “expand” more broadly in the account. The key insights needed for the “conversion assist” sales motion are a bit more involved. In this case, it will be important to understand not just the potential total value of an account as signup (using methods described above), but also the persona of the user signing up. This can be as easy as adding a “Title” required field to your signup form. Understanding when you have an inbound lead who potentially represents substantial purchasing authority is a powerful thing.As an example when I was researching this piece, I was rather surprised that New Relic’s signup page doesn’t provide them with additional information as to “how valuable” the person signing up might be. Whereas Snowflake’s (as shown above) certainly does in the form of the “title” field. Enrichment providers can help here too, by passing back a current title for a given email address if you get a hit. Usually, it’s better to just ask for it, even if you’re afraid it’ll reduce signup conversion.Next, understanding how “activated” users are helps with both the “pod scooping and expansion” case and also the “conversion assist” case. How activated a user gets can show which potential users might need intervention (again, based on their potential value to your organization - large accounts and valuable title), and also where you have pods of highly activated users in larger accounts to prioritize.You likely already have existing indicators of activation with respect to your product - how far someone got through signup, how many features they are using, and how frequently they’re using those features. Now we need to get that information into the hands of the people who will be prioritizing which hung users, or which pods of activated users to engage.At Atrium we use software called Census to help us pipe user activation data into our CRM (Salesforce) such that sales staff can easily consume this information and act accordingly. We’re pretty far down this process, but to start you could use any of your existing product analytics for this – whether that’s Amplitude, Pendo, Mixpanel, Heap, etc. Think for a second about what that reporting would look like: new users in some trailing time period, their activation status, per user, their “account desirability” information, their “user desirability” information (e.g., title), and their contact information. Also, all accounts, grouped by domain (ideally) in order to easily show which organizations have meaningful pockets of activation in them. Ideally, you pipe that information into a go-to-market system like your CRM or marketing automation platform and can start doing business logic against it (to protect engineering resources for product work), but giving your salespeople logins to your product analytics tool can be ok to start. We just want to get it somewhere where the person working on this initial sales motion can consume it, maybe lightly manipulate it, and definitely act on it.As an example of where you can eventually end up, this is what a Salesforce contact object page looks like at Atrium, as a result of about a year of tuning and additions as we got more sophisticated on user activation instrumentation. But even just starting with the last login and total pageviews or actions on a given time interval can be a great start.The same approach applies to alerting. You can push alerts into an email listserve or Slack channel based on certain desirability criteria (“Badass account signed up and didn’t activate!” vs. “Badass account reached awesome activation threshold!” vs. “Account reached critical mass of multiple activated users!”). At Atrium we have email alerting on initial user signup that fires an email to a list-serve and a lead to Salesforce, both of which feature user name, email address, company name, title, size of account (after user sign in with Salesforce we can interrogate the size of their Salesforce user table, which correlates to magnitude of the account), and how far through initial activation they got.Similarly, we have alerting set up using workflow rules and triggers in Salesforce to send pertinent alerting to relevant listserves when users get beyond certain thresholds of activation (“OMG, this user has hit X threshold of feature breadth use and Y threshold of page views in the trailing Z period.”) Once alerted, sales staff use this information to engage the user as relevant (“Wow, it’s time to buy!” or “Wow, you have a bunch of folks getting a ton of value out of this. Let’s roll you all into the same account, eh?”)Is it working?Lastly, since the initial involvement of humans in your commercial motion is an experiment until you’ve validated it’s working, you’ll want to set yourself up to be able to understand just that: is it working? There’s a lot more on this topic in the section from Founding Sales on “Early CRM”, but at minimum, you’ll want some sort of system by which to record the number and state of these early sales conversations. This is typically a CRM of some sort, but even something as basic as Airtable can work. The reason you want to do this is to not just help yourself keep all these parallel conversations straight (in sales, you have to record everything), but also to score the results of your efforts: are we actually getting expansions done? Are we actually getting highly valuable accounts converted? How many of these conversations are we having? What proportion are we winning? More on this in the “Sales Performance Instrumentation” section of Founding Sales, but you want to make sure you’re capturing enough information so you can be honest with yourself as to how it’s actually going. Common pitfalls to avoid Regardless of how well you set yourself up for success, there are a number of pitfalls you’ll want to avoid. 1. Having someone else do salesOne of the things I passionately believe is that founders should be their own first salesperson. Founding Sales was written based on this belief – to make it way easier for founders (or product managers) to do so. Assigning this task to someone else is fraught with downsides, as they won’t have the same product acumen as the founder by which to have productive sales conversations, they won’t be good at product requirements collection as new features crop up needed to facilitate larger contracts, and so on. Yes, it’s a lot of work, but it’s worth it for it to be you, at least to start. Also, you have a huge advantage – you’re the founder/product manager. That’s really cool to users. They want to talk to you. When the Command E founders reached out to my sales reps, they thought it was the raddest thing ever - “The founder of Command E, this product I totally love, wants to talk to little old me?!”2. Not startingA variant of the above is having indications that sales involvement in your growth strategy would make sense, but kicking the can down the road because you’re afraid of it. Selling is not magic, it’s not rocket science, and anyone can learn to do it. Don’t psych yourself out that it’s a huge lift. Adding sales involvement to your commercial motion is no different than adding new features to your product – you can start with a minimum viable approach to experiment, and start iterating yourself towards success. But you do have to start.3. Going top-downThere will likely be a point in the future when a “top-down” motion – where a salesperson starts engaging at the top of an organization with no existing user relationship with your product – will make sense to add your growth motion. Now is not that time. Your current strength and asset is that you have a self-serve product that users love. A top-down motion will mean interacting with decision-makers who are so far removed from the day to day work your product facilitates, they will have far less understanding of why it’s helpful and valuable. Moreover, they’ll likely have all sorts of conceived product requirements that don’t matter a lick to your users but will gate any sort of commercial progression, typically based on advanced features that incumbents have. Slack and Zoom currently have enterprise account executives talking “digital transformation” with CIOs of massive companies where not a single person uses the product. Now is not the time to do that for your offering.4. Not allocating product resourcesYou might think that adding direct sales to a self-serve commercial motion is just about adding people to the mix. It turns out that what actually happens is you start adding incremental “users” to the mix too – they just aren’t end-users. These incremental user personas will have different needs than your existing users, and some of those needs will require new features to satisfy. It will be important to allocate engineering resources to address these needs, otherwise, you may find that your direct sales efforts will be less successful. Moreover, some of these features will be wholly unsexy - like Single Sign-On support, or security credentialing, like SOC 2 or ISO 27001, and more. But these features will end up being important, as their absence will block the sales-assisted use cases you’re seeking to unlock – whether that’s “account merge”, to allow the rolling up of a bunch of disparate self-serve users in an overarching company, or “conversion assist”, where your lack of security credentialing means that a large, prestigious, and commercially attractive account won’t start sending data to your offering.5. Lenny likes lists of 5This is here because Lenny said I should always have either three things or five things in a list 😆Once you have started and are on your way, you’ll eventually want to hand sales off to a dedicated resource. The hiring and management of dedicated salespeople to continue the beginnings of this “sales-assist” motion is beyond the scope of this article, but the chapters on sales hiring, sales onboarding, and early sales management chapters of Founding Sales tackle these topics in-depth.In summaryLayering a rigorous direct sales motion on top of an existing, successful self-serve commercial motion can hypercharge what is already a successful self-serve business. Similarly, foregoing a direct sales motion can leave important parts of the competitive landscape open for other players to eat your lunch. Adding sales to your existing self-serve approach isn’t for every case - but if it is, it can be a huge advantage. The good news is doing so shouldn’t be mysterious, and the guidance above should get you started on your journey.

Please leave a comment and let me know what I might be missing or have wrong 👇Leave a commentThe Racecar Growth Framework—Expanded1. The Growth EngineThe growth engine is a self-sustaining growth loop that drives nearly all your growth long-term. Of all the components, the growth engine is the most important because it’s the only component that can be self-sustaining—creating an output (e.g. revenue) that can then be reinvested into more growth (e.g. ads).There are four common growth engines:SEO: You (or your users) create content → People discover your content while searching (e.g. Google, YouTube, TikTok, etc.) → They become users → More users leads to more contentPaid ads: You run ads online (e.g. FB, AdWords, YouTube), OOH (e.g. billboards, buses), or in-home (e.g. direct mail, TV, podcasts) → Ads drive users → Users generate revenue → Revenue is used to run more adsSales: You hire salespeople → Salespeople get customers → Customers drive revenue → Revenue is used to hire more salespeopleVirality: User signs up → User enjoys product and shares product with other people (either through word of mouth, inviting their friends through your product, sharing content from the app, or incentivized referrals) → Friend signs up and shares it with their friendsHere’s an overview of the growth engines behind today’s biggest consumer apps (second column):Here are the primary growth engines of today’s biggest B2B products (second column)—essentially it’s always sales, though some products have a product-led (aka self-service) element:P.S. In the B2C list, you’ll notice there’s one additional growth engine, “Supply driving demand.” This can be thought of as a growth engine, and an incredibly powerful one at that, but it won’t be the source of your growth, because you still need to grow the supply in the first place (usually through sales), so I don’t spend a lot of time on it. Read more about this engine here.2. KickstartsKickstarts are unscalable tactics for acquiring your first 1,000 users. The nine most common (and effective) kickstarts, including links to examples of each in action:Share with friends and colleaguesReach out to targeted strangersCold DM (e.g. Cameo)Cold email (e.g. YouTube)Phone call (e.g. Airbnb)Door to door (e.g. DoorDash)Go pitch your target audience where they hang outOnline communities (e.g. Dropbox and HackerNews, Discord and Reddit, Netflix and niche forums)Offline communities (e.g. Etsy and craft fairs)Retailers/malls (e.g. Hipcamp and REI, Pinterest and Apple stores, Snapchat and malls)High schools (e.g. Snapchat)College campuses (e.g. Tinder)Business schools (e.g. Morning Brew)Startup offices (e.g. Lyft, Wealthfront)Transit hubs (e.g. Uber and CalTrans station)Enlist influencersPaidOrganically fansGet pressCreate viral contentBlog post (e.g. Superhuman)Video (e.g. Duolingo)One-off website (e.g. Calm)TweetGet physical placementFlyers/handouts (e.g. DoorDash)Table or booth at a physical location (e.g. Hipcamp)Signs (e.g. Tinder)Stickers (e.g. Grubhub)Get on store shelvesHost an eventBe first on a platformIn B2C you have many options, but in B2B you really only have three: friends and colleagues; go pitch them where they hang; and press.Here’s an overview of which products relied on which kickstarts in B2C:And B2B:3. Turbo boostsTurbo boosts are one-off events that accelerate growth temporarily but don’t last. There’s some overlap here with kickstarts, but the difference is that kickstarts are effective for getting you started (e.g. unscalable, scrappy, low investment), while turbo boosts can accelerate growth at any point."},{"title":"GTM motions of 30 B2B SaaS companies","article":"👋 Hey, Lenny here! Welcome to a 🔒 subscriber-only edition 🔒 of my weekly newsletter.

Where do I start?When I think positioning, I immediately think of one person: April Dunford. April is the author of the best-selling book Obviously Awesome, which to me is the definitive book on positioning, and spends her days working with companies of all shapes and sizes helping them nail their positioning.When I received this question, I cold-DM’d April to see if she’d be interested in tackling it, and thankfully she agreed 🎉 Below, you’ll find what I believe is the most succinct and practical guide to nailing your product’s positioning. Let’s dive in!For more from April, check out her Twitter, website, and book.A quickstart guide to positioningby April DunfordMy first job out of school 20 years ago was as a product marketer at a startup. I was assigned to work on a product that had been conceived as a “Microsoft Access killer” that supported SQL and could run on people’s desktops. Back then, SQL databases only ran on big servers. But after a significant marketing effort, we had barely sold 200 copies. We knew it was time to wind it down, but before we did, we decided to check in with buyers to see how upset they would be when we did. Being the new gal, I got the job to make the calls. The first 20 conversations I had were exactly the same:Me: Hi, I’m calling to find out how you’re using our product. Customer: Sorry, lady, we don’t have that.Me: Um, well, my records show you paid $100 for it on Jan 22nd?Customer: Oh, that thing—yeah, we tried it, we don’t use it now. Our decision to kill the product was going to be easy. But then I did call 21. “Your product made me the hero of the sales team!” the customer shouted. At his company, sales folks traveled to their customer, took orders on paper, and then returned to the office to enter them in the order system. Orders were often incomplete or full of errors. Our product was installed on laptops with the order system, allowing sales to take orders in the field and then sync with the SQL database back in the office. “We’re doubling sales! That SQL feature was a game changer for us!” he raved. I thanked him and carried on with my calls.I had 20 more conversations with 20 more customers who barely remembered purchasing before I hit another fan of the product. His story was similar—he used our product on mobile devices for field service agents who could update their system in the field, then sync with the database at headquarters. “We’ve increased service capacity by 60%. Your product is a game changer!” he said. In the end, I talked to 100 customers: 94 didn’t even know they had it, 6 had transformed their business with it. We didn’t exactly have product-market fit in the Sean Ellis sense.I relayed my findings back to the exec team. Instead of killing the product straight away, they decided to take a shot at repositioning our “Microsoft Access killer” as an “embeddable database for mobile devices.” The product took off.A year of massive growth later, we were acquired by a big database company, where the product spawned a product family that generated hundreds of millions in revenue. Over 20 years later, this “failed” product still runs on mobile devices all over the world.Positioning isn’t new—but it’s deeply misunderstoodThis experience sparked my lifelong obsession with positioning. How could we have known in advance that our product was simply mispositioned? Was there a way for us to figure out what really set our product apart, what our value for customers really was, and what customers we should be targeting?Positioning is not as well understood as you might think. If I put a dozen senior marketers in a room together and asked them to define positioning, I’d get a dozen different answers. When I talk about positioning at conferences, I sometimes start by defining what positioning is not: Positioning is not equivalent to messaging. It isn’t a tagline. It’s not your brand story, nor is it your vision or your “why.” It is not, as one CEO attempted to convince me, “everything you marketers cook up over there.”So what is it, and, more importantly, how do we do it?Defining positioningHere’s how I define positioning:‍“Positioning defines how your product is a leader at delivering something that a well-defined set of customers cares a lot about.”Yeah, that sounds a bit complex, but positioning is made up of a distinct set of components. Those components and their relationship to each other is where the magic happens. We will get to that in a minute.Positioning as context settingPositioning is like context setting for products. It’s a bit like the opening scene of a movie. The opening scene gets us oriented. It answers the big questions: Where are we? What year is this? What’s happening? How should I feel? Who are these people? Once we have established some context, we can settle in and pay attention to the story’s finer details. Let’s take the opening scene of Apocalypse Now. We see a grove of peaceful palm trees swaying the breeze and maybe you’re thinking, “Hey, maybe it’s not apocalypse right now,” but then you notice some smoke and a helicopter quickly flies past. Suddenly the palm trees burst into flames as Jim Morrison screams, “This is the end, my friend!” We realize we are in the middle of the Vietnam War and it’s the apocalypse right now alright. Then slowly, the scene shifts and we see Martin Sheen’s face. He’s drinking and smoking, his hotel room is a total mess, and he’s clearly in psychological distress. He walks over to the window and we get the first line of dialogue in the movie: “Saigon. Shit. I’m still only in Saigon. Every time I think I’m gonna wake up back in the jungle.” We are exactly 4 minutes and 45 seconds into the movie, but we know a lot about what’s happening. We are in the middle of the Vietnam War, and in Saigon specifically. Our lead character has been there before and has some pretty bad PTSD as a result. We also get the tone of the movie and we know it’s going to be an intense couple of hours. The opening scene positions the movie by answering our big questions about who, what, where, and why so that we can settle in and focus on the details of the story within that context. Similarly, positioning your product in a market orients the customers and conveys a lot of valuable information. Your positioning context sets off a really powerful set of assumptions about who your product competes with, what features your product should have, who the product is intended for, and even things like what the product should cost.Suppose I pitch you my product, and all I tell you is that it’s a “CRM” and that’s it. What assumptions would you make about my product before I got to page two of my pitch? You would assume my competition is Salesforce—they are the leader in that market. You would assume I sell to the head of sales. You would assume my product has a set of features—tracking deals and accounts, for example. You would even make pricing assumptions. Salesforce is the leader in the market, so you would assume my product costs less than that.Good positioning sets off a set of assumptions about my product that are true. Bad positioning sets off a set of assumptions about my product that aren’t true—leaving your sales and marketing teams to do the work of undoing the damage your positioning has already done. If I were to tell you my product was “email,” you would have a very different set of assumptions than if I positioned it as “chat.” There is a large overlap in features between the two, but as buyers, we expect email to filter spam, allow us to organize and store conversations, and integrate with a calendar. Our expectations for chat are different. We expect instant delivery, a way to see if someone has received or viewed our message, etc. A new product could be positioned in either market, but great chat is lousy email and vice versa. A shift in positioning can completely transform how we perceive a product and can mean the difference between success and failure. A positioning statement can’t help youSo if positioning is so important, how do we do it? Let’s start with what not to do. For many people, positioning was taught to them in school using the “positioning statement.” It’s a sort of Mad Libs fill-in-the-blanks exercise. The blanks are things like market category, value, competitors, etc. Typically it looks something like this:‍I believe this exercise is not only pointless but potentially dangerous. The exercise assumes that there is only one answer for each of the blanks and you simply “know” what it is. However, most products could easily be positioned in multiple different market categories, with different competitors, providing a different value for different kinds of customers. How would this exercise help me understand that my “Microsoft Access killer” was really an “embeddable database for mobile devices?” The answer is that it would not.The 5 components of positioningSo how do we find the best positioning for our offerings? This question vexed me as a marketing executive across seven successful startups (and the six big companies that acquired them). I read books! I took courses! Everyone agreed that positioning was the marketing bedrock we built our entire go-to-market strategy around, and yet there didn’t seem to be a methodology for actually getting it done. I decided to figure it out.I started with an engineering mindset. I decided we could break positioning up into its component pieces, find the best answer for each piece, bring the pieces back together, and voilà—great positioning. Breaking positioning up isn’t hard, because we generally agree on the components. These are, in essence, the blanks in the positioning statement. The components are:Competitive alternativesDifferentiated “features” or “capabilities”Value for customersTarget customer segmentationMarket categoryEasy. Now all we have to do is figure out how to get the best answer for each component. Here’s where things get a little tricky. Each component depends on the othersIf you look at the pieces, you quickly understand that each component has a relationship with the others. For example, the unique value that you can provide to customers is completely dependent on your differentiated features. Your differentiated features are only “differentiated” when you compare them to competitive alternatives. Your best-fit target customers are customers who really care a lot about your unique value. And lastly, your best market category is the context you position your product in such that your unique value is obvious to your target customers. So if every piece has a relationship to every other piece, where do we start?For two years, I didn’t think there was a starting point. I attempted to find the best positioning for my products by picking an arbitrary starting point (for example, differentiated features) and then working my way through the others to get a “candidate positioning.” I would then test it on prospects, and if it worked, we ran with it. If it didn’t, I tossed it out and repeated the process to get another candidate to test. The drawback to this method are obvious to anyone who’s worked at a startup: it just took too long! While I was out testing candidate after candidate, the sales, marketing, and product teams were stuck in a holding pattern waiting.A customer-centric methodologyEventually, Clayton Christensen solved this problem for me. I was reading everything I could get my hands on about the Jobs to Be Done theory, and I had the realization that the starting point had to be competitive alternatives. If it wasn’t, what we ended up with was positioning that sounded good in the office but didn’t work with customers because it wasn’t differentiated. The flow has to look like this:We start with competitive alternatives, or what customers would do if our solution didn’t exist. Once we have that, we can ask ourselves, “What do we have that the alternatives do not?” That gives us a list of differentiated features or key unique attributes. We can then go down that list and ask ourselves, “So what for customers?” Put another way, what is the value those capabilities enable for our buyers? Once we understand what our differentiated value is, then we can move to customer segmentation, or who the customers who care a lot about our value are. There is likely a wide range of buyers who care about that value, but certain customers care a lot more than others. What are the characteristics of a customer that makes them care a lot about your differentiated value? That gives us an idea of who our best-fit customers are. Lastly, we move to market category. Our best market category is the context we position our product in such that our value is obvious to our target customers. Put another way, it is the definition of the market we intend to win. An example: Janna SystemsLet’s walk through an example of how this works. Early in my career, I ran marketing for a company that positioned its product as an enterprise CRM. This was ages ago when Salesforce was still focused on SMBs, and the gorilla in the enterprise CRM market at the time was Siebel Systems. Unsurprisingly, every time we got a meeting with a customer we got the question, “So how are you better than Siebel?” That was a bad question for us because, by almost every measure, they were better than we were. They had 8,000 employees and we had a couple dozen. They had $2 billion in revenue; we did less than $2 million. They had 400 customers and we had 6. We did, however, have two differentiators.The first was a feature that they couldn’t match. Specifically, we could model relationships in a different way. Most CRMs model the relationship between people and an organization. Our CRM let you model relationships between people, independent of their organization. An example would be that we could show that two people sat on a board together even though they work for separate companies. No CRM then (or even today, for that matter) could do that. The problem was that, for the most part, we didn’t do a good job of articulating the value of that. We showed the feature in every demo, and when customers asked us what they would do with that feature, our reply was “Anything you want!”Coming back to the process I laid out in the previous section—our competitor was obvious; it was Siebel. Our differentiator was the ability to model relationships in a different way. What we hadn’t figured out was what the value of that feature was and what types of customers cared a lot about it.Eventually, we landed a deal with an investment bank. Working with that customer helped us understand that the value of our feature was that companies could get insight into interpersonal relationships, which sales teams could use to start new sales conversations and understand who might have influence over a deal in process. For companies that relied heavily on personal relationships (e.g. investment banking, private client services), our product was a game changer.Going back to the positioning process, we could now fill in value and customers who care. This was super-important for our go-to-market strategy. We shifted our sales and marketing efforts to selling to investment banks, where we had a distinct advantage over Siebel.Lastly, we decided to make a change to the market category. Clearly, we couldn’t win Enterprise CRM, but we could win CRM for Investment Banks. Positioning ourselves that way helped banks find us and helped us clearly differentiate from Siebel. This shift in positioning allowed us to grow very quickly over the next 18 months, from under $2M to close to $80M. Our plan was to shift the positioning to CRM for Financial Services as we expanded to retail banks and insurance companies. We didn’t get the chance to test that positioning evolution, however—Siebel acquired us for $1.3B.   Common mistakesOnce you understand the flow conceptually, it’s pretty easy. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t a lot of ways you can mess this process up. Here are the three most common traps:Trap 1: Defining competitive alternatives as any possible competitorThe most common mistake I see startups make is in how they define the competitive alternatives in the first step. A better way to think about competitive alternatives is to ask yourself, “What would a customer do if your offering didn’t exist?” Sometimes the answer to that question is “Do nothing.” What that really means is the customer would stick with their current way of solving the problem. That could mean using a spreadsheet, using a manual process, or hiring an intern to do it. In enterprise software, we typically lose 25% of deals to “no decision.” Your positioning needs to position you against the status quo if you want to convince customers to act. Trap 2: Creating “phantom competitors”Next, I see companies listing what I would call “phantom competitors” in step 1. Phantom competitors are companies that theoretically could compete with you; you just never actually see them or lose to them in deals. Until you do, you are watering down your positioning by trying to position against them. Step 1 in the positioning process is to identify what your customers see as alternatives. This isn’t a test of your internet research skills, and just because a company could compete with you doesn’t mean they ever will. The product team might want to keep an eye on them as a future competitive threat, and if you do start to see them in deals, you can adjust your positioning at that time. Until then, you will weaken your positioning by trying to position against competitors your customers never even consider. Trap 3: Assuming that you have to create a new market category to growWhen selecting a market category, you can either choose to position your product in an existing market category or attempt to create a new category in customers’ minds and then position your product as the leader in it. The first option allows you to use what customers already know and understand about a market to help them understand what your product is and what makes it uniquely special. If I tell you my product is an “embeddable database for mobile devices,” you have the benefit of understanding what a database is. “Embeddable” and “for mobile devices” narrows down the field of alternatives to a market niche where this product is not only different from the leaders in the more generic “database” market category, but much better for a particular kind of buyer.Creating a new market category, on the other hand, is where you invent a new frame of reference for customers. The obvious downside to this strategy is that you first have to make the category mean something in the customer’s mind before it can serve as a meaningful context. So instead of being an “embeddable database for mobile devices,” you choose to be a fluflommer. Yep, a fluflommer. Customers have no idea what that is because you’ve just invented it, so be prepared to spend a significant amount of time and effort making that term mean what you want it to mean.There is an assumption that the payoff for creating a new market category is that you will dominate the market as it grows. In my book, I tell the story of Eloqua and how founder Mark Organ created the Marketing Automation category and did exactly that. Unfortunately, history teaches us that companies that create market categories often lose in the long run to companies that gained a market foothold after the hard work of creating the category was already done. This is why we use Google and not Ask Jeeves. This is why we use Facebook and not Myspace. In fact, 90% of tech companies that have gone public over the past five years have been positioned in existing markets rather than creating new ones. Many of the examples of category creators started out positioning themselves in existing markets before they later stretched the boundaries of that category. Salesforce was a niche play in the CRM space until it had hundreds of millions of revenue. Gainsight was in the survey software market until it had hundreds of millions of revenue. It’s much more common for startups to start out positioning themselves in an existing category until they have the money and momentum required to re-draw the lines around that category.Positioning—you’ve got this!Positioning is a misunderstood concept, but I believe that if you master it, it can be the most powerful strategic tool you have at your disposal.

Any best practices you can share? What had the most impact on conversion at Airbnb?Increasing conversion (a.k.a fix the “leaks” in your funnel, get it?) is one of the highest ROI investments a growth team can make, particularly once you’ve got your top-of-funnel growth engines (e.g. paid, SEO, referrals) up and running. Not only do conversion improvements make your existing growth channels more efficient, the wins last forever (…or at least until you decide to redesign everything).When thinking about conversion, there are two places you can focus: Keeping users in the flowBringing users back into the flowLet’s go through these individually.1. Keeping users in the flowWhen I approach optimizing a funnel, I generally focus on three levers:Maintain user focus as they move through your flow 🧐Maintain user motivation as they move through your flow 🤗Reduce user friction so that they can easily move through your flow 😄You and your team can leverage the above framework by coming up with ideas within each of these three levers, and then testing out your favorites. My advice is to experiment with as many ideas as you can, vs. betting on just a few amazing ideas.If running experiments isn’t possible at your scale (you can use this handy calculator to get a sense), my advice is to do your due diligence (e.g. talk to users, evaluation upside, etc.), but then feel comfortable trusting yourself to go with your best guesses.Airbnb has an incredibly strong culture of experimentation and iteration, and the volume to support it. By the time I left, we had hundreds of experiments running at any given time. From that experimentation, here are some of the biggest conversion wins at Airbnb, that I’m familiar with (by lever):Lever 1: Maintain user focus 🧐Opening listings in a new tab: When you click on an Airbnb listing (in search, from the home page, etc.), it always opens up in a new tab. Why? We found that helping a user avoid losing track of all of their options helps them continue exploring, especially if that first listing didn’t work out. This turned out to be one of the biggest conversion wins 🤷‍♂️Neighborhoods: In late 2012, Airbnb launched a product called “Neighborhoods” which offered users incredibly rich and unique content about individual neighborhoods around the world. Visitors loved it. Almost too much. It turned out the content was so interesting that it distracted visitors from actually booking. When the team removed it from the home page, bookings went up.Setting dates: When you search for a place to stay on Airbnb, you’re encouraged to input the dates for your trip. Though that introduces a tiny bit of friction, it turns out that by restricting your results to homes that are actually available during your trip, you avoid distracting users with better but unavailable options. Adding this prompt had a big impact.Lever 2: Maintain user motivation 🤗Scarcity: Giving users a reason to act now, by conveying a sense of scarcity (e.g. this property is usually booked), is a powerful motivator and a big conversion opportunity.Highlights: Reminding users what’s great about the property they’re booking (e.g. the location, the amenities, the price) helps them avoid reconsidering and bailing, leading to great conversion wins.What’s my place worth: On the host side, the primary motivation for becoming a host is income. Thus, making this value-prop prominent not only on the host landing page, but also throughout the entire new-host-flow (and follow-up emails), was impactful.Lever 3: Reduce user friction 😄Instant Book: By far the biggest friction to booking on Airbnb has always been the host approval process. Over the years, as the platform shifted to predominantly Instant Book, guest conversion significantly increased as a result.  Smart defaults: When you can’t remove steps from a flow, the next best thing is to set smart default answers. For example, as a new host, listing your home involves dozens of questions — your availability, your price, your listing title. We found a lot of success in setting smart default answers (or recommended answers) to as many of these questions as possible, making it easy for new hosts to move through the flow efficiently.Performance: Slow page/app performance is one of the worst types of friction. It frustrates users,  has nothing to do with your actual product, and is often invisible to your team. Though it won’t always work, and it’s often time-consuming to fix, we saw improvements in performance make a big dent in conversion, particularly on mobile.No matter how great your flow is, users will bounce, so let’s talk about bringing them back.2. Bringing users back into the flowMost of your bounced users won’t actually want what you’re selling (sorry). But, a significant percentage of bounced users are just not ready to buy right then, or got distracted by another task, or got confused by your flow. This latter group of users is the users you want to target with a re-engagement strategy. There are two key questions to consider when attempting to re-engage users:WHAT can you tell them to convince them to try again?HOW do you reach them?WHAT to tell bounced usersThe three core content strategies for re-engaging users (though there are probably more):A reminder: You tried to do this thing and you didn’t finish. Want to finish?Something has changed: Since the time you tried to book, prices have come down. Want to try again?There’s more information: Looks like you stopped at this step — did you know that it’s optional?At Airbnb, we had the most success with:Reminding hosts a guest is waiting for a responseReminding visitors that a home they were looking at was still availableChanges in market conditions (e.g. homes are getting booked)Changes to prices (e.g. this listing is now cheaper)Letting new hosts know they were only X steps away from becoming a hostThink about what value you can provide your users that would give them a good reason to try again.HOW to reach bounced usersAnd finally, having a great message is one thing, but getting to your users is another. There are essentially only three re-engagement channels: Emails/push notifications: Simple, effective, but easy to abuse.Retargeting: Paid ads that target site visitors.Calls: Calling prospects that have dropped off.At Airbnb, we employed all three, but mostly email and retargeting. Both were extremely effective, early-on and at scale.To go deeper, here are a few articles I recommend:A/B Testing by Julian ShapiroConversion Rate Optimization by MozThe Conversion Optimization Rulebook by UnbouncePsych’d: A new user psychology framework for increasing funnel conversion by Darius Contractor13 Examples of Re-Engagement Emails by HubSpotNow go fix those leaks.Inspiration for the week ahead 🧠Read: How pollution is improving around the worldN I C 👁 L E @nicoleamurrayThread of newly clear, pollution-free skies around the world.

I haven't found great content on this and I’m guessing you have some advice to share on this.I do indeed! I love referrals programs so much. While leading the supply growth work at Airbnb, one of the teams I oversaw built and scaled the host referrals program. The team (made up of folks much smarter than I) took it from a nascent half-functional program to the single biggest driver of attributable supply growth. Not only that, it quickly became the most efficient paid-growth channel AND drove the highest quality supply. So, yeah, I love referral programs.Since I haven’t written much about this before, I’m going to take this opportunity to share a bunch of learnings. Below, you’ll find the WHAT, WHY, WHO, and HOW of referral programs, along with a bunch of pro tips. Enjoy!WHAT is a referral programA referral program incentivizes you existing users (usually with cash or credit) to refer new users. The program is normally self-service and built into the product experience. Some examples from Airbnb, Uber, and Dropbox:WHY build a referral programImpact: Based on my previous research into marketplace growth, referrals were tied for the second most common early growth lever for supply, and valuable to a handful of companies in driving early demand and when scaling. At companies where referrals work best (see below for more on this), anywhere from 15% to 50% of their new user growth comes from referrals.Efficiency: Instead of just competing for keywords and placement on Google and FB like everyone else, you leverage your existing user base to help you drive growth. When done right, these programs pay for themselves many times over, and you can easily test and tune the incentives to make them increasingly more efficient.Scalability: It takes a very small team to build and operate a referrals program. At Airbnb, we initially had just three people (eng, design, PM), and you can get started with even less.WHO should invest in a referral program:The majority of your current growth comes from word-of-mouth: The added incentive that a referral program offers simply adds fuel to an existing fire. I haven’t seen referrals work when there wasn’t strong existing WOM.Lots of existing users: Do the math to see what conversation rates you’d need in order for a referral program to drive meaningful growth. For example, if you have a few thousand existing “hosts”, it’s unlikely you’ll drive hundreds of new hosts on an ongoing basis through a referral program. Expect less than 10% of your users to convert a successful referral.You’re able to offer a meaningful incentive: The key to a strong referrals program is having an incentive that genuinly motivates people to take action. An extra $10 likely won’t cut it. Talk to your users and get a sense of what they’d get excited about (may not be cash), and then figure out if your CAC/LTV can support it.Your users know a lot of other potential users: Airbnb hosts know other folks with homes, and Dropbox users have friends who would love cheap cloud storage. On the other hand, a head of HR may not know a ton of other heads of HR. Referral programs are most effective when your customers are consumers or small business owners (not enterprises).Your product requires a lot of trust to use: Referrals and WOM are highest leverage when your product is a little bit scary to use (e.g. staying in a stranger’s home, leaving your dog with someone you just met), and benefit from someone they trust recommending it.HOW to build a referral programAt Airbnb, we went through three phases:It exists! Simple incentive: $25 flat-fee travel credit for new guests (both referer and referee), and $75 travel credit for driving new hosts.Limited discoverability: In the nav and footerLimited platforms: Just webOptimized (on the guest side)Increase discoverability: Added many more touchpoints throughout the guest experience, plus added to mobileOptimized messaging: Tested and optimized the pitchDedicated resources: Fully dedicated a team to this programExpanded (to host side)Expanded program: Made the host referral pitch a first-class citizen, including its own landing pageImproved incentive: Made it a cash award (vs. travel credit) – flat $100 for referer, $50 for the refereeIncreased efficiency: Created a personalized referral amount based on the LTV of supply you are likely to driveMetrics we looked at (for our host referral program):Output metricsNew listings (that came through a referral)Bookings (to a listing that came through a referral)InputVisits to the referral landing pageTotal invites sentInvites sent per userConversion of an invite to signupCost efficiency of the programWays to optimize referrals:Eligibility: Who is allowed to send referrals?Discoverability: Do users know it exists?Motivation: Do users have a reason to spend time on this?Conversion: Do users invite the right (and enough) people?Efficiency: Incremental revenue divided by incremental spend.Pro tips:Pitch referrals everywhere: Don’t expect your users to immediately (1) discover, (2) understand, and (3) be motivated to refer friends. Repeat the pitch at every touch-point, highlighting the incentive, and don’t rely on one-off campaigns.Understand cannibalization: Not all of the users that come through a referral are incremental. Many would have signed up anyway. It’s tricky to figure out what haircut to give these numbers, but I’d suggest being conservative.Data science: You’ll be an order of magnitude more successful in developing this program if you have a data scientist deeply involved in the planning and iterations.Incentives plateau: We tested doubling the bonus in some markets and found that it occasionally didn’t make a big dent. Our takeaway was that there’s a point at which you aren’t going to motivate people any further (while still having positive ROI on the program).Fraud: The juicier your incentive, the likelier you are to see fraud. You need to make it more expensive to execute the fraud than benefit from the fraud.Further reading:Referrals At Airbnb: Driving Sustainable & Scalable Growth with Jimmy Tang and Gustaf AlstromerHacking Word-of-Mouth: Making Referrals Work for AirbnbUnder the Microscope: How Airbnb Thinks About Product/Market Fit, Team & MoreHow Airbnb Built One Of The Most Successful Referral Programs EverThough a referral program isn’t right for everyone, for many companies it’s one of the most effective growth levers out there.Go get ‘em!Inspirations for the week ahead 🧠Read: Managers, Take Your 1:1s to the Next Level with These 6 Must Reads — An excellent collection of pro tips for 1:1 meetings, including snippets from yours truly.Watch: Satisfaction: Mug — Make sure your sound is on.Follow: The Browser — A curated weekly collection of beautiful and insightful writing.If you’re finding this newsletter valuable, consider sharing it with friends (or subscribing if you aren’t already)SubscribeSincerely,Lenny 👋"}]}
